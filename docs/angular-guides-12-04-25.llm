# Angular elements overview

_Angular elements_ are Angular components packaged as _custom elements_ \(also called Web Components\), a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way.

[Custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) are a Web Platform feature available on all browsers supported by Angular.
A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code.
The browser maintains a `CustomElementRegistry` of defined custom elements, which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag.

The `@angular/elements` package exports a `createCustomElement()` API that provides a bridge from Angular's component interface and change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API.

Transforming a component to a custom element makes all the required Angular infrastructure available to the browser.
Creating a custom element is simple and straightforward, and automatically connects your component-defined view with change detection and data binding, mapping Angular functionality to the corresponding built-in HTML equivalents.

## Using custom elements

Custom elements bootstrap themselves - they start when they are added to the DOM, and are destroyed when removed from the DOM.
Once a custom element is added to the DOM for any page, it looks and behaves like any other HTML element, and does not require any special knowledge of Angular terms or usage conventions.

To add the `@angular/elements` package to your workspace, run the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">

npm install @angular/elements --save

</docs-code>

### How it works

The `createCustomElement()` function converts a component into a class that can be registered with the browser as a custom element.
After you register your configured class with the browser's custom-element registry, use the new element just like a built-in HTML element in content that you add directly into the DOM:

<docs-code language="html">

<my-popup message="Use Angular!"></my-popup>

</docs-code>

When your custom element is placed on a page, the browser creates an instance of the registered class and adds it to the DOM.
The content is provided by the component's template, which uses Angular template syntax, and is rendered using the component and DOM data.
Input properties in the component correspond to input attributes for the element.

## Transforming components to custom elements

Angular provides the `createCustomElement()` function for converting an Angular component, together with its dependencies, to a custom element.

The conversion process implements the `NgElementConstructor` interface, and creates a
constructor class that is configured to produce a self-bootstrapping instance of your component.

Use the browser's native [`customElements.define()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry/define) function to register the configured constructor and its associated custom-element tag with the browser's [`CustomElementRegistry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry).
When the browser encounters the tag for the registered element, it uses the constructor to create a custom-element instance.

IMPORTANT: Avoid using the component's selector as the custom element tag name.
This can lead to unexpected behavior, due to Angular creating two component instances for a single DOM element:
One regular Angular component and a second one using the custom element.

### Mapping

A custom element _hosts_ an Angular component, providing a bridge between the data and logic defined in the component and standard DOM APIs.
Component properties and logic maps directly into HTML attributes and the browser's event system.

* The creation API parses the component looking for input properties, and defines corresponding attributes for the custom element.
  It transforms the property names to make them compatible with custom elements, which do not recognize case distinctions.
  The resulting attribute names use dash-separated lowercase.
  For example, for a component with `@Input('myInputProp') inputProp`, the corresponding custom element defines an attribute `my-input-prop`.

* Component outputs are dispatched as HTML [Custom Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent), with the name of the custom event matching the output name.
    For example, for a component with `@Output() valueChanged = new EventEmitter()`, the corresponding custom element dispatches events with the name "valueChanged", and the emitted data is stored on the event's `detail` property.
    If you provide an alias, that value is used; for example, `@Output('myClick') clicks = new EventEmitter<string>();` results in dispatch events with the name "myClick".

For more information, see Web Component documentation for [Creating custom events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events#Creating_custom_events).

## Example: A Popup Service

Previously, when you wanted to add a component to an application at runtime, you had to define a _dynamic component_, and then you would have to load it, attach it to an element in the DOM, and wire up all of the dependencies, change detection, and event handling.

Using an Angular custom element makes the process simpler and more transparent, by providing all the infrastructure and framework automatically —all you have to do is define the kind of event handling you want.
\(You do still have to exclude the component from compilation, if you are not going to use it in your application.\)

The following Popup Service example application defines a component that you can either load dynamically or convert to a custom element.

| Files                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `popup.component.ts` | Defines a simple pop-up element that displays an input message, with some animation and styling.                                                                                                                             |
| `popup.service.ts`   | Creates an injectable service that provides two different ways to invoke the `PopupComponent`; as a dynamic component, or as a custom element. Notice how much more setup is required for the dynamic-loading method.        |  |
| `app.component.ts`   | Defines the application's root component, which uses the `PopupService` to add the pop-up to the DOM at run time. When the application runs, the root component's constructor converts `PopupComponent` to a custom element. |

For comparison, the demo shows both methods.
One button adds the popup using the dynamic-loading method, and the other uses the custom element.
The result is the same, but the preparation is different.

    <docs-code header="app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/elements/src/app/app.component.ts"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

## Typings for custom elements

Generic DOM APIs, such as `document.createElement()` or `document.querySelector()`, return an element type that is appropriate for the specified arguments.
For example, calling `document.createElement('a')` returns an `HTMLAnchorElement`, which TypeScript knows has an `href` property.
Similarly, `document.createElement('div')` returns an `HTMLDivElement`, which TypeScript knows has no `href` property.

When called with unknown elements, such as a custom element name \(`popup-element` in our example\), the methods return a generic type, such as `HTMLElement`, because TypeScript can't infer the correct type of the returned element.

Custom elements created with Angular extend `NgElement` \(which in turn extends `HTMLElement`\).
Additionally, these custom elements will have a property for each input of the corresponding component.
For example, our `popup-element` has a `message` property of type `string`.

There are a few options if you want to get correct types for your custom elements.
Assume you create a `my-dialog` custom element based on the following component:

<docs-code language="typescript">

@Component(…)
class MyDialog {
  @Input() content: string;
}

</docs-code>

The most straightforward way to get accurate typings is to cast the return value of the relevant DOM methods to the correct type.
For that, use the `NgElement` and `WithProperties` types \(both exported from `@angular/elements`\):

<docs-code language="typescript">

const aDialog = document.createElement('my-dialog') as NgElement & WithProperties<{content: string}>;
aDialog.content = 'Hello, world!';
aDialog.content = 123;  // <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows this should be a string.
aDialog.body = 'News';  // <-- ERROR: TypeScript knows there is no `body` property on `aDialog`.

</docs-code>

This is a good way to quickly get TypeScript features, such as type checking and autocomplete support, for your custom element.
But it can get cumbersome if you need it in several places, because you have to cast the return type on every occurrence.

An alternative way, that only requires defining each custom element's type once, is augmenting the `HTMLElementTagNameMap`, which TypeScript uses to infer the type of a returned element based on its tag name \(for DOM methods such as `document.createElement()`, `document.querySelector()`, etc.\):

<docs-code language="typescript">

declare global {
  interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
    'my-dialog': NgElement & WithProperties<{content: string}>;
    'my-other-element': NgElement & WithProperties<{foo: 'bar'}>;
    …
  }
}

</docs-code>

Now, TypeScript can infer the correct type the same way it does for built-in elements:

<docs-code language="typescript">

document.createElement('div')               //--> HTMLDivElement (built-in element)
document.querySelector('foo')               //--> Element        (unknown element)
document.createElement('my-dialog')         //--> NgElement & WithProperties<{content: string}> (custom element)
document.querySelector('my-other-element')  //--> NgElement & WithProperties<{foo: 'bar'}>      (custom element)

</docs-code>

## Limitations

Care should be taken when destroying and then re-attaching custom elements created with `@angular/elements` due to issues with the [disconnect()](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/38778) callback. Cases where you may run into this issue are:

- Rendering a component in an `ng-if` or `ng-repeat` in `AngularJs`
- Manually detaching and re-attaching an element to the DOM

================================================
# Hydration

## What is hydration

Hydration is the process that restores the server-side rendered application on the client. This includes things like reusing the server rendered DOM structures, persisting the application state, transferring application data that was retrieved already by the server, and other processes.

## Why is hydration important?

Hydration improves application performance by avoiding extra work to re-create DOM nodes. Instead, Angular tries to match existing DOM elements to the applications structure at runtime and reuses DOM nodes when possible. This results in a performance improvement that can be measured using [Core Web Vitals (CWV)](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) statistics, such as reducing the First Input Delay ([FID](https://web.dev/fid/)) and Largest Contentful Paint ([LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/)), as well as Cumulative Layout Shift ([CLS](https://web.dev/cls/)). Improving these numbers also affects things like SEO performance.

Without hydration enabled, server-side rendered Angular applications will destroy and re-render the application's DOM, which may result in a visible UI flicker. This re-rendering can negatively impact [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) like [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/) and cause a layout shift. Enabling hydration allows the existing DOM to be re-used and prevents a flicker.

## How do you enable hydration in Angular

Hydration can be enabled for server-side rendered (SSR) applications only. Follow the [Angular SSR Guide](guide/ssr) to enable server-side rendering first.

### Using Angular CLI

If you've used Angular CLI to enable SSR (either by enabling it during application creation or later via `ng add @angular/ssr`), the code that enables hydration should already be included into your application.

### Manual setup

If you have a custom setup and didn't use Angular CLI to enable SSR, you can enable hydration manually by visiting your main application component or module and importing `provideClientHydration` from `@angular/platform-browser`. You'll then add that provider to your app's bootstrapping providers list.

```typescript
import {
  bootstrapApplication,
  provideClientHydration,
} from '@angular/platform-browser';
...

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideClientHydration()]
});
```

Alternatively if you are using NgModules, you would add `provideClientHydration` to your root app module's provider list.

```typescript
import {provideClientHydration} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  exports: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  providers: [provideClientHydration()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the `provideClientHydration()` call is also included into a set of providers that is used to bootstrap an application on the **server**. In applications with the default project structure (generated by the `ng new` command), adding a call to the root `AppModule` should be sufficient, since this module is imported by the server module. If you use a custom setup, add the `provideClientHydration()` call to the providers list in the server bootstrap configuration.

### Verify that hydration is enabled

After you've configured hydration and have started up your server, load your application in the browser.

HELPFUL: You will likely need to fix instances of Direct DOM Manipulation before hydration will fully work either by switching to Angular constructs or by using `ngSkipHydration`. See [Constraints](#constraints), [Direct DOM Manipulation](#direct-dom-manipulation), and [How to skip hydration for particular components](#how-to-skip-hydration-for-particular-components) for more details.

While running an application in dev mode, you can confirm hydration is enabled by opening the Developer Tools in your browser and viewing the console. You should see a message that includes hydration-related stats, such as the number of components and nodes hydrated. Angular calculates the stats based on all components rendered on a page, including those that come from third-party libraries.

You can also use [Angular DevTools browser extension](tools/devtools) to see hydration status of components on a page. Angular DevTools also allows to enable an overlay to indicate which parts of the page were hydrated. If there is a hydration mismatch error - DevTools would also highlight a component that caused the error.

## Capturing and replaying events

When an application is rendered on the server, it is visible in a browser as soon as produced HTML loads. Users may assume that they can interact with the page, but event listeners are not attached until hydration completes. Starting from v18, you can enable the Event Replay feature that allows to capture all events that happen before hydration and replay those events once hydration has completed. You can enable it using the `withEventReplay()` function, for example:

```typescript
import {provideClientHydration, withEventReplay} from '@angular/platform-browser';

bootstrapApplication(App, {
  providers: [
    provideClientHydration(withEventReplay())
  ]
});
```

### How event replay works
Event Replay is a feature that improves user experience by capturing user events that were triggered before the hydration process is complete. Then those events are replayed, ensuring none of that interaction was lost.

The Event Replay is divided into three main phases:

- **Capturing user interactions**<br>
Prior to **Hydration**, Event Replay captures and stores all interactions that the user may perform, such as clicks and other browser native events.

- **Storing events**<br>
The **Event Contract** keeps in memory all the interactions recorded in the previous step, ensuring that they are not lost for later replay.

- **Relaunch of events**<br>
Once **Hydration** is complete, Angular re-invokes the captured events.

Event replay supports _native browser events_, for example `click`, `mouseover`, and `focusin`. If you'd like to learn more about JSAction, the library that powers event replay, you can read more [on the readme](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/core/primitives/event-dispatch#readme).

---

This feature ensures a consistent user experience, preventing user actions performed before Hydration from being ignored. NOTE: if you have [incremental hydration](guide/incremental-hydration) enabled, event replay is automatically enabled under the hood.

## Constraints

Hydration imposes a few constraints on your application that are not present without hydration enabled. Your application must have the same generated DOM structure on both the server and the client. The process of hydration expects the DOM tree to have the same structure in both places. This also includes whitespaces and comment nodes that Angular produces during the rendering on the server. Those whitespaces and nodes must be present in the HTML generated by the server-side rendering process.

IMPORTANT: The HTML produced by the server side rendering operation **must not** be altered between the server and the client.

If there is a mismatch between server and client DOM tree structures, the hydration process will encounter problems attempting to match up what was expected to what is actually present in the DOM. Components that do direct DOM manipulation using native DOM APIs are the most common culprit.

### Direct DOM Manipulation

If you have components that manipulate the DOM using native DOM APIs or use `innerHTML` or `outerHTML`, the hydration process will encounter errors. Specific cases where DOM manipulation is a problem are situations like accessing the `document`, querying for specific elements, and injecting additional nodes using `appendChild`. Detaching DOM nodes and moving them to other locations will also result in errors.

This is because Angular is unaware of these DOM changes and cannot resolve them during the hydration process. Angular will expect a certain structure, but it will encounter a different structure when attempting to hydrate. This mismatch will result in hydration failure and throw a DOM mismatch error ([see below](#errors)).

It is best to refactor your component to avoid this sort of DOM manipulation. Try to use Angular APIs to do this work, if you can. If you cannot refactor this behavior, use the `ngSkipHydration` attribute ([described below](#how-to-skip-hydration-for-particular-components)) until you can refactor into a hydration friendly solution.

### Valid HTML structure

There are a few cases where if you have a component template that does not have valid HTML structure, this could result in a DOM mismatch error during hydration.

As an example, here are some of the most common cases of this issue.

- `<table>` without a `<tbody>`
- `<div>` inside a `<p>`
- `<a>` inside another `<a>`

If you are uncertain about whether your HTML is valid, you can use a [syntax validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check it.

NOTE: While the HTML standard does not require the `<tbody>` element inside tables, modern browsers automatically create a `<tbody>` element in tables that do not declare one. Because of this inconsistency, always explicitly declare a `<tbody>` element in tables to avoid hydration errors.

### Preserve Whitespaces Configuration

When using the hydration feature, we recommend using the default setting of `false` for `preserveWhitespaces`. If this setting is not in your tsconfig, the value will be `false` and no changes are required. If you choose to enable preserving whitespaces by adding `preserveWhitespaces: true` to your tsconfig, it is possible you may encounter issues with hydration. This is not yet a fully supported configuration.

HELPFUL: Make sure that this setting is set **consistently** in `tsconfig.server.json` for your server and `tsconfig.app.json` for your browser builds. A mismatched value will cause hydration to break.

If you choose to set this setting in your tsconfig, we recommend to set it only in `tsconfig.app.json` which by default the `tsconfig.server.json` will inherit it from.

### Custom or Noop Zone.js are not yet supported

Hydration relies on a signal from Zone.js when it becomes stable inside an application, so that Angular can start the serialization process on the server or post-hydration cleanup on the client to remove DOM nodes that remained unclaimed.

Providing a custom or a "noop" Zone.js implementation may lead to a different timing of the "stable" event, thus triggering the serialization or the cleanup too early or too late. This is not yet a fully supported configuration and you may need to adjust the timing of the `onStable` event in the custom Zone.js implementation.

## Errors

There are several hydration related errors you may encounter ranging from node mismatches to cases when the `ngSkipHydration` was used on an invalid host node. The most common error case that may occur is due to direct DOM manipulation using native APIs that results in hydration being unable to find or match the expected DOM tree structure on the client that was rendered by the server. The other case you may encounter this type of error was mentioned in the [Valid HTML structure](#valid-html-structure) section earlier. So, make sure the HTML in your templates are using valid structure, and you'll avoid that error case.

For a full reference on hydration related errors, visit the [Errors Reference Guide](/errors).

## How to skip hydration for particular components

Some components may not work properly with hydration enabled due to some of the aforementioned issues, like [Direct DOM Manipulation](#direct-dom-manipulation). As a workaround, you can add the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to a component's tag in order to skip hydrating the entire component.

```angular-html
<app-example ngSkipHydration />
```

Alternatively you can set `ngSkipHydration` as a host binding.

```typescript
@Component({
  ...
  host: {ngSkipHydration: 'true'},
})
class ExampleComponent {}
```

The `ngSkipHydration` attribute will force Angular to skip hydrating the entire component and its children. Using this attribute means that the component will behave as if hydration is not enabled, meaning it will destroy and re-render itself.

HELPFUL: This will fix rendering issues, but it means that for this component (and its children), you don't get the benefits of hydration. You will need to adjust your component's implementation to avoid hydration-breaking patterns (i.e. Direct DOM Manipulation) to be able to remove the skip hydration annotation.

The `ngSkipHydration` attribute can only be used on component host nodes. Angular throws an error if this attribute is added to other nodes.

Keep in mind that adding the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to your root application component would effectively disable hydration for your entire application. Be careful and thoughtful about using this attribute. It is intended as a last resort workaround. Components that break hydration should be considered bugs that need to be fixed.

## Hydration Timing and Application Stability

Application stability is an important part of the hydration process. Hydration and any post-hydration processes only occur once the application has reported stability. There are a number of ways that stability can be delayed. Examples include setting timeouts and intervals, unresolved promises, and pending microtasks. In those cases, you may encounter the [Application remains unstable](errors/NG0506) error, which indicates that your app has not yet reached the stable state after 10 seconds. If you're finding that your application is not hydrating right away, take a look at what is impacting application stability and refactor to avoid causing these delays.

## I18N

HELPFUL: Support for internationalization with hydration is currently in [developer preview](/reference/releases#developer-preview). By default, Angular will skip hydration for components that use i18n blocks, effectively re-rendering those components from scratch.

To enable hydration for i18n blocks, you can add [`withI18nSupport`](/api/platform-browser/withI18nSupport) to your `provideClientHydration` call.

```typescript
import {
  bootstrapApplication,
  provideClientHydration,
  withI18nSupport,
} from '@angular/platform-browser';
...

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideClientHydration(withI18nSupport())]
});
```

## Consistent rendering across server-side and client-side
Avoid introducing `@if` blocks and other conditionals that display different content when server-side rendering than client-side rendering, such as using an `@if` block with Angular's `isPlatformBrowser` function. These rendering differences cause layout shifts, negatively impacting end-user experience and core web vitals.

## Third Party Libraries with DOM Manipulation

There are a number of third party libraries that depend on DOM manipulation to be able to render. D3 charts is a prime example. These libraries worked without hydration, but they may cause DOM mismatch errors when hydration is enabled. For now, if you encounter DOM mismatch errors using one of these libraries, you can add the `ngSkipHydration` attribute to the component that renders using that library.

## Third Party Scripts with DOM Manipulation

Many third party scripts, such as ad trackers and analytics, modify the DOM before hydration can occur. These scripts may cause hydration errors because the page no longer matches the structure expected by Angular. Prefer deferring this type of script until after hydration whenever possible. Consider using [`AfterNextRender`](api/core/afterNextRender) to delay the script until post-hydration processes have occured.

## Incremental Hydration

Incremental hydration is an advanced form of hydration that allows for more granular control over when hydration happens. See the [incremental hydration guide](guide/incremental-hydration) for more information.

# Getting started with NgOptimizedImage

The `NgOptimizedImage` directive makes it easy to adopt performance best practices for loading images.

The directive ensures that the loading of the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](http://web.dev/lcp) image is prioritized by:

* Automatically setting the `fetchpriority` attribute on the `<img>` tag
* Lazy loading other images by default
* Automatically generating a preconnect link tag in the document head
* Automatically generating a `srcset` attribute
* Generating a [preload hint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload) if app is using SSR

In addition to optimizing the loading of the LCP image, `NgOptimizedImage` enforces a number of image best practices, such as:

* Using [image CDN URLs to apply image optimizations](https://web.dev/image-cdns/#how-image-cdns-use-urls-to-indicate-optimization-options)
* Preventing layout shift by requiring `width` and `height`
* Warning if `width` or `height` have been set incorrectly
* Warning if the image will be visually distorted when rendered

If you're using a background image in CSS, [start here](#how-to-migrate-your-background-image).

**NOTE: Although the `NgOptimizedImage` directive was made a stable feature in Angular version 15, it has been backported and is available as a stable feature in versions 13.4.0 and 14.3.0 as well.**

## Getting Started

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Import `NgOptimizedImage` directive">
Import `NgOptimizedImage` directive from `@angular/common`:

<docs-code language="typescript">

import { NgOptimizedImage } from '@angular/common'

</docs-code>

and include it into the `imports` array of a standalone component or an NgModule:

<docs-code language="typescript">

imports: [
  NgOptimizedImage,
  // ...
],

</docs-code>
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="(Optional) Set up a Loader">
An image loader is not **required** in order to use NgOptimizedImage, but using one with an image CDN enables powerful performance features, including automatic `srcset`s for your images.

A brief guide for setting up a loader can be found in the [Configuring an Image Loader](#configuring-an-image-loader-for-ngoptimizedimage) section at the end of this page.
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Enable the directive">
To activate the `NgOptimizedImage` directive, replace your image's `src` attribute with `ngSrc`.

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg">

</docs-code>

If you're using a [built-in third-party loader](#built-in-loaders), make sure to omit the base URL path from `src`, as that will be prepended automatically by the loader.
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Mark images as `priority`">
Always mark the [LCP image](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered) on your page as `priority` to prioritize its loading.

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" priority>

</docs-code>

Marking an image as `priority` applies the following optimizations:

* Sets `fetchpriority=high` (read more about priority hints [here](https://web.dev/priority-hints))
* Sets `loading=eager` (read more about native lazy loading [here](https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading))
* Automatically generates a [preload link element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload) if [rendering on the server](guide/ssr).

Angular displays a warning during development if the LCP element is an image that does not have the `priority` attribute. A page’s LCP element can vary based on a number of factors - such as the dimensions of a user's screen, so a page may have multiple images that should be marked `priority`. See [CSS for Web Vitals](https://web.dev/css-web-vitals/#images-and-largest-contentful-paint-lcp) for more details.
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Include Width and Height">
In order to prevent [image-related layout shifts](https://web.dev/css-web-vitals/#images-and-layout-shifts), NgOptimizedImage requires that you specify a height and width for your image, as follows:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200">

</docs-code>

For **responsive images** (images which you've styled to grow and shrink relative to the viewport), the `width` and `height` attributes should be the intrinsic size of the image file. For responsive images it's also important to [set a value for `sizes`.](#responsive-images)

For **fixed size images**, the `width` and `height` attributes should reflect the desired rendered size of the image. The aspect ratio of these attributes should always match the intrinsic aspect ratio of the image.

NOTE: If you don't know the size of your images, consider using "fill mode" to inherit the size of the parent container, as described below.
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

## Using `fill` mode

In cases where you want to have an image fill a containing element, you can use the `fill` attribute. This is often useful when you want to achieve a "background image" behavior. It can also be helpful when you don't know the exact width and height of your image, but you do have a parent container with a known size that you'd like to fit your image into (see "object-fit" below).

When you add the `fill` attribute to your image, you do not need and should not include a `width` and `height`, as in this example:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" fill>

</docs-code>

You can use the [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) CSS property to change how the image will fill its container. If you style your image with `object-fit: "contain"`, the image will maintain its aspect ratio and be "letterboxed" to fit the element. If you set `object-fit: "cover"`, the element will retain its aspect ratio, fully fill the element, and some content may be "cropped" off.

See visual examples of the above at the [MDN object-fit documentation.](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)

You can also style your image with the [object-position property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) to adjust its position within its containing element.

IMPORTANT: For the "fill" image to render properly, its parent element **must** be styled with `position: "relative"`, `position: "fixed"`, or `position: "absolute"`.

## How to migrate your background image

Here's a simple step-by-step process for migrating from `background-image` to `NgOptimizedImage`. For these steps, we'll refer to the element that has an image background as the "containing element":

1) Remove the `background-image` style from the containing element.
2) Ensure that the containing element has `position: "relative"`, `position: "fixed"`, or `position: "absolute"`.
3) Create a new image element as a child of the containing element, using `ngSrc` to enable the `NgOptimizedImage` directive.
4) Give that element the `fill` attribute. Do not include a `height` and `width`.
5) If you believe this image might be your [LCP element](https://web.dev/lcp/), add the `priority` attribute to the image element.

You can adjust how the background image fills the container as described in the [Using fill mode](#using-fill-mode) section.


## Using placeholders

### Automatic placeholders

NgOptimizedImage can display an automatic low-resolution placeholder for your image if you're using a CDN or image host that provides automatic image resizing. Take advantage of this feature by adding the `placeholder` attribute to your image:

<docs-code format="typescript" language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" placeholder>

</docs-code>

Adding this attribute automatically requests a second, smaller version of the image using your specified image loader. This small image will be applied as a `background-image` style with a CSS blur while your image loads. If no image loader is provided, no placeholder image can be generated and an error will be thrown.

The default size for generated placeholders is 30px wide. You can change this size by specifying a pixel value in the `IMAGE_CONFIG` provider, as seen below:

<docs-code format="typescript" language="typescript">
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_CONFIG,
    useValue: {
      placeholderResolution: 40
    }
  },
],
</docs-code>

If you want sharp edges around your blurred placeholder, you can wrap your image in a containing `<div>` with the `overflow: hidden` style. As long as the `<div>` is the same size as the image (such as by using the `width: fit-content` style), the "fuzzy edges" of the placeholder will be hidden.

### Data URL placeholders

You can also specify a placeholder using a base64 [data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs) without an image loader. The data url format is `data:image/[imagetype];[data]`, where `[imagetype]` is the image format, just as `png`, and `[data]` is a base64 encoding of the image. That encoding can be done using the command line or in JavaScript. For specific commands, see [the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs#encoding_data_into_base64_format). An example of a data URL placeholder with truncated data is shown below:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img
  ngSrc="cat.jpg"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  placeholder="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."
/>

</docs-code>

However, large data URLs  increase the size of your Angular bundles and slow down page load. If you cannot use an image loader, the Angular team recommends keeping base64 placeholder images smaller than 4KB and using them exclusively on critical images. In addition to decreasing placeholder dimensions, consider changing image formats or parameters used when saving images. At very low resolutions, these parameters can have a large effect on file size.

### Non-blurred placeholders

By default, NgOptimizedImage applies a CSS blur effect to image placeholders. To render a placeholder without blur, provide a `placeholderConfig` argument with an object that includes the `blur` property, set to false. For example:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img
  ngSrc="cat.jpg"
  width="400"
  height="200"
  placeholder
  [placeholderConfig]="{blur: false}"
/>

</docs-code>

## Adjusting image styling

Depending on the image's styling, adding `width` and `height` attributes may cause the image to render differently. `NgOptimizedImage` warns you if your image styling renders the image at a distorted aspect ratio.

You can typically fix this by adding `height: auto` or `width: auto` to your image styles. For more information, see the [web.dev article on the `<img>` tag](https://web.dev/patterns/web-vitals-patterns/images/img-tag).

If the `width` and `height` attribute on the image are preventing you from sizing the image the way you want with CSS, consider using `fill` mode instead, and styling the image's parent element.

## Performance Features

NgOptimizedImage includes a number of features designed to improve loading performance in your app. These features are described in this section.

### Add resource hints

A [`preconnect` resource hint](https://web.dev/preconnect-and-dns-prefetch) for your image origin ensures that the LCP image loads as quickly as possible.

Preconnect links are automatically generated for domains provided as an argument to a [loader](#optional-set-up-a-loader). If an image origin cannot be automatically identified, and no preconnect link is detected for the LCP image, `NgOptimizedImage` will warn during development. In that case, you should manually add a resource hint to `index.html`. Within the `<head>` of the document, add a `link` tag with `rel="preconnect"`, as shown below:

<docs-code language="html">

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://my.cdn.origin" />

</docs-code>


To disable preconnect warnings, inject the `PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST` token:

<docs-code language="typescript">

providers: [
  {provide: PRECONNECT_CHECK_BLOCKLIST, useValue: 'https://your-domain.com'}
],

</docs-code>

See more information on automatic preconnect generation [here](#why-is-a-preconnect-element-not-being-generated-for-my-image-domain).


### Request images at the correct size with automatic `srcset`

Defining a [`srcset` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset) ensures that the browser requests an image at the right size for your user's viewport, so it doesn't waste time downloading an image that's too large. `NgOptimizedImage` generates an appropriate `srcset` for the image, based on the presence and value of the [`sizes` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) on the image tag.

#### Fixed-size images

If your image should be "fixed" in size  (i.e. the same size across devices, except for [pixel density](https://web.dev/codelab-density-descriptors/)), there is no need to set a `sizes` attribute. A `srcset` can be generated automatically from the image's width and height attributes with no further input required.

Example srcset generated:
```angular-html
<img ... srcset="image-400w.jpg 1x, image-800w.jpg 2x">
```

#### Responsive images

If your image should be responsive (i.e. grow and shrink according to viewport size), then you will need to define a [`sizes` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) to generate the `srcset`.

If you haven't used `sizes` before, a good place to start is to set it based on viewport width. For example, if your CSS causes the image to fill 100% of viewport width, set `sizes` to `100vw` and the browser will select the image in the `srcset` that is closest to the viewport width (after accounting for pixel density). If your image is only likely to take up half the screen (ex: in a sidebar), set `sizes` to `50vw` to ensure the browser selects a smaller image. And so on.

If you find that the above does not cover your desired image behavior, see the documentation on [advanced sizes values](#advanced-sizes-values).

Note that `NgOptimizedImage` automatically prepends `"auto"` to the provided `sizes` value. This is an optimization that increases the accuracy of srcset selection on browsers which support `sizes="auto"`, and is ignored by browsers which do not.

By default, the responsive breakpoints are:

`[16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840]`

If you would like to customize these breakpoints, you can do so using the `IMAGE_CONFIG` provider:

<docs-code language="typescript">
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_CONFIG,
    useValue: {
      breakpoints: [16, 48, 96, 128, 384, 640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920]
    }
  },
],
</docs-code>

If you would like to manually define a `srcset` attribute, you can provide your own using the `ngSrcset` attribute:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w">

</docs-code>

If the `ngSrcset` attribute is present, `NgOptimizedImage` generates and sets the `srcset` based on the sizes included. Do not include image file names in `ngSrcset` - the directive infers this information from `ngSrc`. The directive supports both width descriptors (e.g. `100w`) and density descriptors (e.g. `1x`).

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="hero.jpg" ngSrcset="100w, 200w, 300w" sizes="50vw">

</docs-code>

### Disabling automatic srcset generation

To disable srcset generation for a single image, you can add the `disableOptimizedSrcset` attribute on the image:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="about.jpg" disableOptimizedSrcset>

</docs-code>

### Disabling image lazy loading

By default, `NgOptimizedImage` sets `loading=lazy` for all images that are not marked `priority`. You can disable this behavior for non-priority images by setting the `loading` attribute. This attribute accepts values: `eager`, `auto`, and `lazy`. [See the documentation for the standard image `loading` attribute for details](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/loading#value).

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" loading="eager">

</docs-code>

### Advanced 'sizes' values

You may want to have images displayed at varying widths on differently-sized screens. A common example of this pattern is a grid- or column-based layout that renders a single column on mobile devices, and two columns on larger devices. You can capture this behavior in the `sizes` attribute, using a "media query" syntax, such as the following:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="cat.jpg" width="400" height="200" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw">

</docs-code>

The `sizes` attribute in the above example says "I expect this image to be 100 percent of the screen width on devices under 768px wide. Otherwise, I expect it to be 50 percent of the screen width.

For additional information about the `sizes` attribute, see [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes) or [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes).

## Configuring an image loader for `NgOptimizedImage`

A "loader" is a function that generates an [image transformation URL](https://web.dev/image-cdns/#how-image-cdns-use-urls-to-indicate-optimization-options) for a given image file. When appropriate, `NgOptimizedImage` sets the size, format, and image quality transformations for an image.

`NgOptimizedImage` provides both a generic loader that applies no transformations, as well as loaders for various third-party image services. It also supports writing your own custom loader.

| Loader type| Behavior |
|:--- |:--- |
| Generic loader | The URL returned by the generic loader will always match the value of `src`. In other words, this loader applies no transformations. Sites that use Angular to serve images are the primary intended use case for this loader.|
| Loaders for third-party image services | The URL returned by the loaders for third-party image services will follow API conventions used by that particular image service. |
| Custom loaders | A custom loader's behavior is defined by its developer. You should use a custom loader if your image service isn't supported by the loaders that come preconfigured with `NgOptimizedImage`.|

Based on the image services commonly used with Angular applications, `NgOptimizedImage` provides loaders preconfigured to work with the following image services:

| Image Service | Angular API | Documentation |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Cloudflare Image Resizing | `provideCloudflareLoader` | [Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/image-resizing/) |
| Cloudinary | `provideCloudinaryLoader` | [Documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/resizing_and_cropping) |
| ImageKit | `provideImageKitLoader` | [Documentation](https://docs.imagekit.io/) |
| Imgix | `provideImgixLoader` | [Documentation](https://docs.imgix.com/) |
| Netlify | `provideNetlifyLoader` | [Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/image-cdn/overview/) |

To use the **generic loader** no additional code changes are necessary. This is the default behavior.

### Built-in Loaders

To use an existing loader for a **third-party image service**, add the provider factory for your chosen service to the `providers` array. In the example below, the Imgix loader is used:

<docs-code language="typescript">
providers: [
  provideImgixLoader('https://my.base.url/'),
],
</docs-code>

The base URL for your image assets should be passed to the provider factory as an argument. For most sites, this base URL should match one of the following patterns:

* <https://yoursite.yourcdn.com>
* <https://subdomain.yoursite.com>
* <https://subdomain.yourcdn.com/yoursite>

You can learn more about the base URL structure in the docs of a corresponding CDN provider.

### Custom Loaders

To use a **custom loader**, provide your loader function as a value for the `IMAGE_LOADER` DI token. In the example below, the custom loader function returns a URL starting with `https://example.com` that includes `src` and `width` as URL parameters.

<docs-code language="typescript">
providers: [
  {
    provide: IMAGE_LOADER,
    useValue: (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {
      return `https://example.com/images?src=${config.src}&width=${config.width}`;
    },
  },
],
</docs-code>

A loader function for the `NgOptimizedImage` directive takes an object with the `ImageLoaderConfig` type (from `@angular/common`) as its argument and returns the absolute URL of the image asset. The `ImageLoaderConfig` object contains the `src` property, and optional `width` and `loaderParams` properties.

NOTE: even though the `width` property may not always be present, a custom loader must use it to support requesting images at various widths in order for `ngSrcset` to work properly.

### The `loaderParams` Property

There is an additional attribute supported by the `NgOptimizedImage` directive, called `loaderParams`, which is specifically designed to support the use of custom loaders. The `loaderParams` attribute takes an object with any properties as a value, and does not do anything on its own. The data in `loaderParams` is added to the `ImageLoaderConfig` object passed to your custom loader, and can be used to control the behavior of the loader.

A common use for `loaderParams` is controlling advanced image CDN features.

### Example custom loader

The following shows an example of a custom loader function. This example function concatenates `src` and `width`, and uses `loaderParams` to control a custom CDN feature for rounded corners:

<docs-code language="typescript">
const myCustomLoader = (config: ImageLoaderConfig) => {
  let url = `https://example.com/images/${config.src}?`;
  let queryParams = [];
  if (config.width) {
    queryParams.push(`w=${config.width}`);
  }
  if (config.loaderParams?.roundedCorners) {
    queryParams.push('mask=corners&corner-radius=5');
  }
  return url + queryParams.join('&');
};
</docs-code>

Note that in the above example, we've invented the 'roundedCorners' property name to control a feature of our custom loader. We could then use this feature when creating an image, as follows:

<docs-code language="angular-html">

<img ngSrc="profile.jpg" width="300" height="300" [loaderParams]="{roundedCorners: true}">

</docs-code>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does NgOptimizedImage support the `background-image` css property?

The NgOptimizedImage does not directly support the `background-image` css property, but it is designed to easily accommodate the use case of having an image as the background of another element.

For a step-by-step process for migration from `background-image` to `NgOptimizedImage`, see the [How to migrate your background image](#how-to-migrate-your-background-image) section above.

### Why can't I use `src` with `NgOptimizedImage`?

The `ngSrc` attribute was chosen as the trigger for NgOptimizedImage due to technical considerations around how images are loaded by the browser. NgOptimizedImage makes programmatic changes to the `loading` attribute -- if the browser sees the `src` attribute before those changes are made, it will begin eagerly downloading the image file, and the loading changes will be ignored.

### Why is a preconnect element not being generated for my image domain?
Preconnect generation is performed based on static analysis of your application. That means that the image domain must be directly included in the loader parameter, as in the following example:

<docs-code language="typescript">
providers: [
  provideImgixLoader('https://my.base.url/'),
],
</docs-code>

If you use a variable to pass the domain string to the loader, or you're not using a loader, the static analysis will not be able to identify the domain, and no preconnect link will be generated. In this case you should manually add a preconnect link to the document head, as [described above](#add-resource-hints).


### Can I use two different image domains in the same page?

The [image loaders](#configuring-an-image-loader-for-ngoptimizedimage) provider pattern is designed to be as simple as possible for the common use case of having only a single image CDN used within a component. However, it's still very possible to manage multiple image CDNs using a single provider.

To do this, we recommend writing a [custom image loader](#custom-loaders) which uses the [`loaderParams` property](#the-loaderparams-property) to pass a flag that specifies which image CDN should be used, and then invokes the appropriate loader based on that flag.

### Can you add a new built-in loader for my preferred CDN?

For maintenance reasons, we don't currently plan to support additional built-in loaders in the Angular repository. Instead, we encourage developers to publish any additional image loaders as third-party packages.

### Can I use this with the `<picture>` tag

No, but this is on our roadmap, so stay tuned.

If you're waiting on this feature, please upvote the Github issue [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/56594).

### How do I find my LCP image with Chrome DevTools?

1. Using the performance tab of the Chrome DevTools, click on the "start profiling and reload page" button on the top left. It looks like a page refresh icon.

2. This will trigger a profiling snapshot of your Angular application.

3. Once the profiling result is available, select "LCP" in the timings section.

4. A summary entry should appear in the panel at the bottom. You can find the LCP element in the row for "related node".  Clicking on it will reveal the element in the Elements panel.

<img alt="LCP in the Chrome DevTools" src="assets/images/guide/image-optimization/devtools-lcp.png">

NOTE: This only identifies the LCP element within the viewport of the page you are testing. It is also recommended to use mobile emulation to identify the LCP element for smaller screens.

# Incremental Hydration

TIP: Incremental hydration is currently in [developer preview](/reference/releases#developer-preview).

**Incremental hydration** is an advanced type of [hydration](guide/hydration) that can leave sections of your application dehydrated and _incrementally_ trigger hydration of those sections as they are needed.

## Why use incremental hydration?

Incremental hydration is a performance improvement that builds on top of full application hydration. It can produce smaller initial bundles while still providing an end-user experience that is comparable to a full application hydration experience. Smaller bundles improve initial load times, reducing [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid) and [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls).

Incremental hydration also lets you use deferrable views (`@defer`) for content that may not have been deferrable before. Specifically, you can now use deferrable views for content that is above the fold. Prior to incremental hydration, putting a `@defer` block above the fold would result in placeholder content rendering and then being replaced by the `@defer` block's main template content. This would result in a layout shift. Incremental hydration means the main template of the `@defer` block will render with no layout shift on hydration.

## How do you enable incremental hydration in Angular?

You can enable incremental hydration for applications that already use server-side rendering (SSR) with hydration. Follow the [Angular SSR Guide](guide/ssr) to enable server-side rendering and the [Angular Hydration Guide](guide/hydration) to enable hydration first.

Enable incremental hydration by adding the `withIncrementalHydration()` function to the `provideClientHydration` provider.

```typescript
import {
  bootstrapApplication,
  provideClientHydration,
  withIncrementalHydration,
} from '@angular/platform-browser';
...

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideClientHydration(withIncrementalHydration())]
});
```

Incremental Hydration depends on and enables [event replay](guide/hydration#capturing-and-replaying-events) automatically. If you already have `withEventReplay()` in your list, you can safely remove it after enabling incremental hydration.

## How does incremental hydration work?

Incremental hydration builds on top of full-application [hydration](guide/hydration), [deferrable views](guide/defer), and [event replay](guide/hydration#capturing-and-replaying-events). With incremental hydration, you can add additional triggers to `@defer` blocks that define incremental hydration boundaries. Adding a `hydrate` trigger to a defer block tells Angular that it should load that defer block's dependencies during server-side rendering and render the main template rather than the `@placeholder`. When client-side rendering, the dependencies are still deferred, and the defer block content stays dehydrated until its `hydrate` trigger fires. That trigger tells the defer block to fetch its dependencies and hydrate the content. Any browser events, specifically those that match listeners registered in your component, that are triggered by the user prior to hydration are queued up and replayed once the hydration process is complete.

## Controlling hydration of content with triggers

You can specify **hydrate triggers** that control when Angular loads and hydrates deferred content. These are additional triggers that can be used alongside regular `@defer` triggers.

Each `@defer` block may have multiple hydrate event triggers, separated with a semicolon (`;`). Angular triggers hydration when _any_ of the triggers fire.

There are three types of hydrate triggers: `hydrate on`, `hydrate when`, and `hydrate never`.

### `hydrate on`

`hydrate on` specifies a condition for when hydration is triggered for the `@defer` block.

The available triggers are as follows:

| Trigger                                             | Description                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`hydrate on idle`](#hydrate-on-idle)               | Triggers when the browser is idle.                                     |
| [`hydrate on viewport`](#hydrate-on-viewport)       | Triggers when specified content enters the viewport                    |
| [`hydrate on interaction`](#hydrate-on-interaction) | Triggers when the user interacts with specified element                |
| [`hydrate on hover`](#hydrate-on-hover)             | Triggers when the mouse hovers over specified area                     |
| [`hydrate on immediate`](#hydrate-on-immediate)     | Triggers immediately after non-deferred content has finished rendering |
| [`hydrate on timer`](#hydrate-on-timer)             | Triggers after a specific duration                                     |

#### `hydrate on idle`

The `hydrate on idle` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content once the browser has reached an idle state, based on `requestIdleCallback`.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on idle) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `hydrate on viewport`

The `hydrate on viewport` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the corresponding page of the app when the specified content enters the viewport using the
[Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on viewport) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `hydrate on interaction`

The `hydrate on interaction` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content when the user interacts with the specified element through
`click` or `keydown` events.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on interaction) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `hydrate on hover`

The `hydrate on hover` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content when the mouse has hovered over the triggered area through the
`mouseover` and `focusin` events.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on hover) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `hydrate on immediate`

The `hydrate on immediate` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content immediately. This means that the deferred block loads as soon
as all other non-deferred content has finished rendering.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on immediate) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `hydrate on timer`

The `hydrate on timer` trigger loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content after a specified duration.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on timer(500ms)) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

The duration parameter must be specified in milliseconds (`ms`) or seconds (`s`).

### `hydrate when`

The `hydrate when` trigger accepts a custom conditional expression and loads the deferrable view's dependencies and hydrates the content when the
condition becomes truthy.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate when condition) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

NOTE: `hydrate when` conditions only trigger when they are the top-most dehydrated `@defer` block. The condition provided for the trigger is
specified in the parent component, which needs to exist before it can be triggered. If the parent block is dehydrated, that expression will not yet
be resolvable by Angular.

### `hydrate never`

The `hydrate never` allows users to specify that the content in the defer block should remain dehydrated indefinitely, effectively becoming static
content. Note that this applies to the initial render only. During a subsequent client-side render, a `@defer` block with `hydrate never` would
still fetch dependencies, as hydration only applies to initial load of server-side rendered content. In the example below, subsequent client-side
renders would load the `@defer` block dependencies on viewport.

```angular-html
@defer (on viewport; hydrate never) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

NOTE: Using `hydrate never` prevents hydration of the entire nested subtree of a given `@defer` block. No other `hydrate` triggers fire for content nested underneath that block.

## Hydrate triggers alongside regular triggers

Hydrate triggers are additional triggers that are used alongside regular triggers on a `@defer` block. Hydration is an initial load optimization, and that means hydrate triggers only apply to that initial load. Any subsequent client side render will still use the regular trigger.

```angular-html
@defer (on idle; hydrate on interaction) {
  <example-cmp />
} @placeholder{
  <div>Example Placeholder</div>
}
```

In this example, on the initial load, the `hydrate on interaction` applies. Hydration will be triggered on interaction with the `<example-cmp />` component. On any subsequent page load that is client-side rendered, for example when a user clicks a routerLink that loads a page with this component, the `on idle` will apply.

## How does incremental hydration work with nested `@defer` blocks?

Angular's component and dependency system is hierarchical, which means hydrating any component requires all of its parents also be hydrated. So if hydration is triggered for a child `@defer` block of a nested set of dehydrated `@defer` blocks, hydration is triggered from the top-most dehydrated `@defer` block down to the triggered child and fire in that order.

```angular-html
@defer (hydrate on interaction) {
  <parent-block-cmp />
  @defer (hydrate on hover) {
    <child-block-cmp />
  } @placeholder {
    <div>Child placeholder</div>
  }
} @placeholder{
  <div>Parent Placeholder</div>
}
```

In the above example, hovering over the nested `@defer` block triggers hydration. The parent `@defer` block with the `<parent-block-cmp />` hydrates first, then the child `@defer` block with `<child-block-cmp />` hydrates after.

## Constraints

Incremental hydration has the same constraints as full-application hydration, including limits on direct DOM manipulation and requiring valid HTML structure. Visit the [Hydration guide constraints](guide/hydration#constraints) section for more details.

## Do I still need to specify `@placeholder` blocks?

Yes. `@placeholder` block content is not used for incremental hydration, but a `@placeholder` is still necessary for subsequent client-side rendering cases. If your content was not on the route that was part of the initial load, then any navigation to the route that has your `@defer` block content renders like a regular `@defer` block. So the `@placeholder` is rendered in those client-side rendering cases.

# Security

This topic describes Angular's built-in protections against common web application vulnerabilities and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks.
It doesn't cover application-level security, such as authentication and authorization.

For more information about the attacks and mitigations described below, see the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project).

<docs-callout title="Reporting vulnerabilities">

Angular is part of Google [Open Source Software Vulnerability Reward Program](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6521337925468160/google-open-source-software-vulnerability-reward-program-rules). For vulnerabilities in Angular, please submit your report at [https://bughunters.google.com](https://bughunters.google.com/report).

For more information about how Google handles security issues, see [Google's security philosophy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity).

</docs-callout>

## Best practices

These are some best practices to ensure that your Angular application is secure.

1. **Keep current with the latest Angular library releases** - The Angular libraries get regular updates, and these updates might fix security defects discovered in previous versions. Check the Angular [change log](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for security-related updates.
2. **Don't alter your copy of Angular** - Private, customized versions of Angular tend to fall behind the current version and might not include important security fixes and enhancements. Instead, share your Angular improvements with the community and make a pull request.
3. **Avoid Angular APIs marked in the documentation as "_Security Risk_"** - For more information, see the [Trusting safe values](#trusting-safe-values) section of this page.

## Preventing cross-site scripting (XSS)

[Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) enables attackers to inject malicious code into web pages.
Such code can then, for example, steal user and login data, or perform actions that impersonate the user.
This is one of the most common attacks on the web.

To block XSS attacks, you must prevent malicious code from entering the Document Object Model (DOM).
For example, if attackers can trick you into inserting a `<script>` tag in the DOM, they can run arbitrary code on your website.
The attack isn't limited to `<script>` tags —many elements and properties in the DOM allow code execution, for example, `<img alt="" onerror="...">` and `<a href="javascript:...">`.
If attacker-controlled data enters the DOM, expect security vulnerabilities.

### Angular's cross-site scripting security model

To systematically block XSS bugs, Angular treats all values as untrusted by default.
When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template binding, or interpolation, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values.
If a value was already sanitized outside of Angular and is considered safe, communicate this to Angular by marking the [value as trusted](#trusting-safe-values).

Unlike values to be used for rendering, Angular templates are considered trusted by default, and should be treated as executable code.
Never create templates by concatenating user input and template syntax.
Doing this would enable attackers to [inject arbitrary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection) into your application.
To prevent these vulnerabilities, always use the default [Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) template compiler](#use-the-aot-template-compiler) in production deployments.

An extra layer of protection can be provided through the use of Content security policy and Trusted Types.
These web platform features operate at the DOM level which is the most effective place to prevent XSS issues. Here they can't be bypassed using other, lower-level APIs.
For this reason, it is strongly encouraged to take advantage of these features. To do this, configure the [content security policy](#content-security-policy) for the application and enable [trusted types enforcement](#enforcing-trusted-types).

### Sanitization and security contexts

*Sanitization* is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM.
In many cases, sanitization doesn't change a value at all.
Sanitization depends on a context.
For example, a value that's harmless in CSS is potentially dangerous in a URL.

Angular defines the following security contexts:

| Security contexts | Details                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML              | Used when interpreting a value as HTML, for example, when binding to `innerHtml`. |
| Style             | Used when binding CSS into the `style` property.                                  |
| URL               | Used for URL properties, such as `<a href>`.                                      |
| Resource URL      | A URL that is loaded and executed as code, for example, in `<script src>`.        |

Angular sanitizes untrusted values for HTML and URLs. Sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code.
In development mode, Angular prints a console warning when it has to change a value during sanitization.

### Sanitization example

The following template binds the value of `htmlSnippet`. Once by interpolating it into an element's content, and once by binding it to the `innerHTML` property of an element:

<docs-code header="src/app/inner-html-binding.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/inner-html-binding.component.html"/>

Interpolated content is always escaped —the HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content.

For the HTML to be interpreted, bind it to an HTML property such as `innerHTML`.
Be aware that binding a value that an attacker might control into `innerHTML` normally causes an XSS vulnerability.
For example, one could run JavaScript in a following way:

<docs-code header="src/app/inner-html-binding.component.ts (class)" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/inner-html-binding.component.ts" visibleRegion="class"/>

Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, which removes the `script` element but keeps safe content such as the `<b>` element.

<img alt="A screenshot showing interpolated and bound HTML values" src="assets/images/guide/security/binding-inner-html.png#small">

### Direct use of the DOM APIs and explicit sanitization calls

Unless you enforce Trusted Types, the built-in browser DOM APIs don't automatically protect you from security vulnerabilities.
For example, `document`, the node available through `ElementRef`, and many third-party APIs contain unsafe methods.
Likewise, if you interact with other libraries that manipulate the DOM, you likely won't have the same automatic sanitization as with Angular interpolations.
Avoid directly interacting with the DOM and instead use Angular templates where possible.

For cases where this is unavoidable, use the built-in Angular sanitization functions.
Sanitize untrusted values with the [DomSanitizer.sanitize](api/platform-browser/DomSanitizer#sanitize) method and the appropriate `SecurityContext`.
That function also accepts values that were marked as trusted using the `bypassSecurityTrust` functions, and does not sanitize them, as [described below](#trusting-safe-values).

### Trusting safe values

Sometimes applications genuinely need to include executable code, display an `<iframe>` from some URL, or construct potentially dangerous URLs.
To prevent automatic sanitization in these situations, tell Angular that you inspected a value, checked how it was created, and made sure it is secure.
Do _be careful_.
If you trust a value that might be malicious, you are introducing a security vulnerability into your application.
If in doubt, find a professional security reviewer.

To mark a value as trusted, inject `DomSanitizer` and call one of the following methods:

* `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`
* `bypassSecurityTrustScript`
* `bypassSecurityTrustStyle`
* `bypassSecurityTrustUrl`
* `bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl`

Remember, whether a value is safe depends on context, so choose the right context for your intended use of the value.
Imagine that the following template needs to bind a URL to a `javascript:alert(...)` call:

<docs-code header="src/app/bypass-security.component.html (URL)" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/bypass-security.component.html" visibleRegion="URL"/>

Normally, Angular automatically sanitizes the URL, disables the dangerous code, and in development mode, logs this action to the console.
To prevent this, mark the URL value as a trusted URL using the `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` call:

<docs-code header="src/app/bypass-security.component.ts (trust-url)" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/bypass-security.component.ts" visibleRegion="trust-url"/>

<img alt="A screenshot showing an alert box created from a trusted URL" src="assets/images/guide/security/bypass-security-component.png#medium">

If you need to convert user input into a trusted value, use a component method.
The following template lets users enter a YouTube video ID and load the corresponding video in an `<iframe>`.
The `<iframe src>` attribute is a resource URL security context, because an untrusted source can, for example, smuggle in file downloads that unsuspecting users could run.
To prevent this, call a method on the component to construct a trusted video URL, which causes Angular to let binding into `<iframe src>`:

<docs-code header="src/app/bypass-security.component.html (iframe)" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/bypass-security.component.html" visibleRegion="iframe"/>

<docs-code header="src/app/bypass-security.component.ts (trust-video-url)" path="adev/src/content/examples/security/src/app/bypass-security.component.ts" visibleRegion="trust-video-url"/>

### Content security policy

Content Security Policy \(CSP\) is a defense-in-depth technique to prevent XSS.
To enable CSP, configure your web server to return an appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
Read more about content security policy at the [Web Fundamentals guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp) on the Google Developers website.

The minimal policy required for a brand-new Angular application is:

<docs-code language="text">

default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere';

</docs-code>

When serving your Angular application, the server should include a  randomly-generated nonce in the HTTP header for each request.
You must provide this nonce to Angular so that the framework can render `<style>` elements.
You can set the nonce for Angular in one of two ways:

1. Set the `ngCspNonce` attribute on the root application element as `<app ngCspNonce="randomNonceGoesHere"></app>`. Use this approach if you have access to server-side templating that can add the nonce both to the header and the `index.html` when constructing the response.
2. Provide the nonce using the `CSP_NONCE` injection token. Use this approach if you have access to the nonce at runtime and you want to be able to cache the `index.html`.

<docs-code language="typescript">

import {bootstrapApplication, CSP_NONCE} from '@angular/core';
import {AppComponent} from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [{
    provide: CSP_NONCE,
    useValue: globalThis.myRandomNonceValue
  }]
});

</docs-code>

<docs-callout title="Unique nonces">

Always ensure that the nonces you provide are <strong>unique per request</strong> and that they are not predictable or guessable.
If an attacker can predict future nonces, they can circumvent the protections offered by CSP.

</docs-callout>

If you cannot generate nonces in your project, you can allow inline styles by adding `'unsafe-inline'` to the `style-src` section of the CSP header.

| Sections                                         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `style-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere';`  | Allows the page to load global styles from the same origin \(`'self'`\) and styles inserted by Angular with the `nonce-randomNonceGoesHere`.                                                                    |
| `script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomNonceGoesHere';` | Allows the page to load JavaScript from the same origin \(`'self'`\) and scripts inserted by the Angular CLI with the `nonce-randomNonceGoesHere`. This is only required if you're using critical CSS inlining. |

Angular itself requires only these settings to function correctly.
As your project grows, you may need to expand your CSP settings to accommodate extra features specific to your application.

### Enforcing Trusted Types

It is recommended that you use [Trusted Types](https://w3c.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/) as a way to help secure your applications from cross-site scripting attacks.
Trusted Types is a [web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform) feature that can help you prevent cross-site scripting attacks by enforcing safer coding practices.
Trusted Types can also help simplify the auditing of application code.

<docs-callout title="Trusted types">

Trusted Types might not yet be available in all browsers your application targets.
In the case your Trusted-Types-enabled application runs in a browser that doesn't support Trusted Types, the features of the application are preserved. Your application is guarded against XSS by way of Angular's DomSanitizer.
See [caniuse.com/trusted-types](https://caniuse.com/trusted-types) for the current browser support.

</docs-callout>

To enforce Trusted Types for your application, you must configure your application's web server to emit HTTP headers with one of the following Angular policies:

| Policies                 | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `angular`                | This policy is used in security-reviewed code that is internal to Angular, and is required for Angular to function when Trusted Types are enforced. Any inline template values or content sanitized by Angular is treated as safe by this policy.                                          |
| `angular#bundler`        | This policy is used by the Angular CLI bundler when creating lazy chunk files.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `angular#unsafe-bypass`  | This policy is used for applications that use any of the methods in Angular's [DomSanitizer](api/platform-browser/DomSanitizer) that bypass security, such as `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`. Any application that uses these methods must enable this policy.                                  |
| `angular#unsafe-jit`     | This policy is used by the [Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler](api/core/Compiler). You must enable this policy if your application interacts directly with the JIT compiler or is running in JIT mode using the [platform browser dynamic](api/platform-browser-dynamic/platformBrowserDynamic). |
| `angular#unsafe-upgrade` | This policy is used by the [@angular/upgrade](api/upgrade/static/UpgradeModule) package. You must enable this policy if your application is an AngularJS hybrid. |

You should configure the HTTP headers for Trusted Types in the following locations:

* Production serving infrastructure
* Angular CLI \(`ng serve`\), using the `headers` property in the `angular.json` file, for local development and end-to-end testing
* Karma \(`ng test`\), using the `customHeaders` property in the `karma.config.js` file, for unit testing

The following is an example of a header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular:

<docs-code language="html">

Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

</docs-code>

An example of a header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications that use any of Angular's methods in [DomSanitizer](api/platform-browser/DomSanitizer) that bypasses security:

<docs-code language="html">

Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular angular#unsafe-bypass; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

</docs-code>

The following is an example of a header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications using JIT:

<docs-code language="html">

Content-Security-Policy: trusted-types angular angular#unsafe-jit; require-trusted-types-for 'script';

</docs-code>

The following is an example of a header specifically configured for Trusted Types and Angular applications that use lazy loading of modules:

[Prevent DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerabilities with Trusted Types](https://web.dev/trusted-types/#how-to-use-trusted-types)

</docs-callout>

### Use the AOT template compiler

The AOT template compiler prevents a whole class of vulnerabilities called template injection, and greatly improves application performance.
The AOT template compiler is the default compiler used by Angular CLI applications, and you should use it in all production deployments.

An alternative to the AOT compiler is the JIT compiler which compiles templates to executable template code within the browser at runtime.
Angular trusts template code, so dynamically generating templates and compiling them, in particular templates containing user data, circumvents Angular's built-in protections. This is a security anti-pattern.
For information about dynamically constructing forms in a safe way, see the [Dynamic Forms](guide/forms/dynamic-forms) guide.

### Server-side XSS protection

HTML constructed on the server is vulnerable to injection attacks.
Injecting template code into an Angular application is the same as injecting executable code into the application:
It gives the attacker full control over the application.
To prevent this, use a templating language that automatically escapes values to prevent XSS vulnerabilities on the server.
Don't create Angular templates on the server side using a templating language. This carries a high risk of introducing template-injection vulnerabilities.

## HTTP-level vulnerabilities

Angular has built-in support to help prevent two common HTTP vulnerabilities, cross-site request forgery \(CSRF or XSRF\) and cross-site script inclusion \(XSSI\).
Both of these must be mitigated primarily on the server side, but Angular provides helpers to make integration on the client side easier.

### Cross-site request forgery

In a cross-site request forgery \(CSRF or XSRF\), an attacker tricks the user into visiting a different web page \(such as `evil.com`\) with malignant code. This web page secretly sends a malicious request to the application's web server \(such as `example-bank.com`\).

Assume the user is logged into the application at `example-bank.com`.
The user opens an email and clicks a link to `evil.com`, which opens in a new tab.

The `evil.com` page immediately sends a malicious request to `example-bank.com`.
Perhaps it's a request to transfer money from the user's account to the attacker's account.
The browser automatically sends the `example-bank.com` cookies, including the authentication cookie, with this request.

If the `example-bank.com` server lacks XSRF protection, it can't tell the difference between a legitimate request from the application and the forged request from `evil.com`.

To prevent this, the application must ensure that a user request originates from the real application, not from a different site.
The server and client must cooperate to thwart this attack.

In a common anti-XSRF technique, the application server sends a randomly created authentication token in a cookie.
The client code reads the cookie and adds a custom request header with the token in all following requests.
The server compares the received cookie value to the request header value and rejects the request if the values are missing or don't match.

This technique is effective because all browsers implement the _same origin policy_.
Only code from the website on which cookies are set can read the cookies from that site and set custom headers on requests to that site.
That means only your application can read this cookie token and set the custom header.
The malicious code on `evil.com` can't.

### `HttpClient` XSRF/CSRF security

`HttpClient` supports a [common mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token) used to prevent XSRF attacks. When performing HTTP requests, an interceptor reads a token from a cookie, by default `XSRF-TOKEN`, and sets it as an HTTP header, `X-XSRF-TOKEN`. Because only code that runs on your domain could read the cookie, the backend can be certain that the HTTP request came from your client application and not an attacker.

By default, an interceptor sends this header on all mutating requests (such as `POST`) to relative URLs, but not on GET/HEAD requests or on requests with an absolute URL.

<docs-callout helpful title="Why not protect GET requests?">
CSRF protection is only needed for requests that can change state on the backend. By their nature, CSRF attacks cross domain boundaries, and the web's [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) will prevent an attacking page from retrieving the results of authenticated GET requests.
</docs-callout>

To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on either the page load or the first GET request. On subsequent requests the server can verify that the cookie matches the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure that only code running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server; this prevents the client from making up its own tokens. Set the token to a digest of your site's authentication cookie with a salt for added security.

To prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the same domain or subdomain, give each application a unique cookie name.

<docs-callout important title="HttpClient supports only the client half of the XSRF protection scheme">
  Your backend service must be configured to set the cookie for your page, and to verify that the header is present on all eligible requests. Failing to do so renders Angular's default protection ineffective.
</docs-callout>

### Configure custom cookie/header names

If your backend service uses different names for the XSRF token cookie or header, use `withXsrfConfiguration` to override the defaults.

Add it to the `provideHttpClient` call as follows:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withXsrfConfiguration({
        cookieName: 'CUSTOM_XSRF_TOKEN',
        headerName: 'X-Custom-Xsrf-Header',
      }),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

### Disabling XSRF protection

If the built-in XSRF protection mechanism doesn't work for your application, you can disable it using the `withNoXsrfProtection` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withNoXsrfProtection(),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

For information about CSRF at the Open Web Application Security Project \(OWASP\), see [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) and [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
The Stanford University paper [Robust Defenses for Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf) is a rich source of detail.

See also Dave Smith's [talk on XSRF at AngularConnect 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9inczw6qtpY "Cross Site Request Funkery Securing Your Angular Apps From Evil Doers").

### Cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)

Cross-site script inclusion, also known as JSON vulnerability, can allow an attacker's website to read data from a JSON API.
The attack works on older browsers by overriding built-in JavaScript object constructors, and then including an API URL using a `<script>` tag.

This attack is only successful if the returned JSON is executable as JavaScript.
Servers can prevent an attack by prefixing all JSON responses to make them non-executable, by convention, using the well-known string `")]}',\n"`.

Angular's `HttpClient` library recognizes this convention and automatically strips the string `")]}',\n"` from all responses before further parsing.

For more information, see the XSSI section of this [Google web security blog post](https://security.googleblog.com/2011/05/website-security-for-webmasters.html).

## Auditing Angular applications

Angular applications must follow the same security principles as regular web applications, and must be audited as such.
Angular-specific APIs that should be audited in a security review, such as the [_bypassSecurityTrust_](#trusting-safe-values) methods, are marked in the documentation as security sensitive.

# Server and hybrid rendering

## What is hybrid rendering?

Hybrid rendering combines the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR), pre-rendering (also known as "static site generation" or SSG) and client-side rendering (CSR) to optimize your Angular application. It allows you to render different parts of your application using different strategies, giving you fine-grained control over how your app is delivered to users.

## Setting up hybrid rendering

You can create a **new** project with server-side rendering with the Angular CLI:

```shell
ng new --ssr
```

You can also add server-side rendering to an existing project with the `ng add` command:

```shell
ng add @angular/ssr
```

NOTE: By default, Angular prerenders your entire application and generates a server file. To disable this and create a fully static app, set `outputMode` to `static`. To enable SSR, update the server routes to use `RenderMode.Server`.
For more details, see [`Server routing`](#server-routing) and [`Generate a fully static application`](#generate-a-fully-static-application).

## Server routing

### Configuring server routes

You can create a server route config by declaring an array of [`ServerRoute`](api/ssr/ServerRoute 'API reference') objects. This configuration typically lives in a file named `app.routes.server.ts`.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: '', // This renders the "/" route on the client (CSR)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Client,
  },
  {
    path: 'about', // This page is static, so we prerender it (SSG)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
  },
  {
    path: 'profile', // This page requires user-specific data, so we use SSR
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
  },
  {
    path: '**', // All other routes will be rendered on the server (SSR)
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
  },
];
```

You can add this config to your application with [`provideServerRendering`](api/ssr/provideServerRendering 'API reference') using the [`withRoutes`](api/ssr/withRoutes 'API reference') function:

```typescript
import { provideServerRendering, withRoutes } from '@angular/ssr';
import { serverRoutes } from './app.routes.server';

// app.config.server.ts
const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideServerRendering(withRoutes(serverRoutes)),
    // ... other providers ...
  ]
};
```

When using the [App shell pattern](ecosystem/service-workers/app-shell), you must specify the component to be used as the app shell for client-side rendered routes. To do this, use the [`withAppShell`](api/ssr/withAppShell 'API reference') fetaure:

```typescript
import { provideServerRendering, withRoutes, withAppShell } from '@angular/ssr';
import { AppShellComponent } from './app-shell/app-shell.component';

const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideServerRendering(
      withRoutes(serverRoutes),
      withAppShell(AppShellComponent),
    ),
    // ... other providers ...
  ]
};
```

### Rendering modes

The server routing configuration lets you specify how each route in your application should render by setting a [`RenderMode`](api/ssr/RenderMode 'API reference'):

| Rendering mode      | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server (SSR)**    | Renders the application on the server for each request, sending a fully populated HTML page to the browser. |
| **Client (CSR)**    | Renders the application in the browser. This is the default Angular behavior.                               |
| **Prerender (SSG)** | Prerenders the application at build time, generating static HTML files for each route.                      |

#### Choosing a rendering mode

Each rendering mode has different benefits and drawbacks. You can choose rendering modes based on the specific needs of your application.

##### Client-side rendering

Client-side rendering has the simplest development model, as you can write code that assumes it always runs in a web browser. This lets you use a wide range of client-side libraries that also assume they run in a browser.

Client-side rendering generally has worse performance than other rendering modes, as it must download, parse, and execute your page's JavaScript before the user can see any rendered content. If your page fetches more data from the server as it renders, users also have to wait for those additional requests before they can view the complete content.

If your page is indexed by search crawlers, client-side rendering may negatively affect search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers have limits to how much JavaScript they execute when indexing a page.

When client-side rendering, the server does not need to do any work to render a page beyond serving static JavaScript assets. You may consider this factor if server cost is a concern.

Applications that support installable, offline experiences with [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) can rely on client-side rendering without needing to communicate with a server.

##### Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering offers faster page loads than client-side rendering. Instead of waiting for JavaScript to download and run, the server directly renders an HTML document upon receiving a request from the browser. The user experiences only the latency necessary for the server to fetch data and render the requested page. This mode also eliminates the need for additional network requests from the browser, as your code can fetch data during rendering on the server.

Server-side rendering generally has excellent search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers receive a fully rendered HTML document.

Server-side rendering requires you to author code that does not strictly depend on browser APIs and limits your selection of JavaScript libraries that assume they run in a browser.

When server-side rendering, your server runs Angular to produce an HTML response for every request which may increase server hosting costs.

##### Build-time prerendering

Prerendering offers faster page loads than both client-side rendering and server-side rendering. Because prerendering creates HTML documents at _build-time_, the server can directly respond to requests with the static HTML document without any additional work.

Prerendering requires that all information necessary to render a page is available at _build-time_. This means that prerendered pages cannot include any data to the specific user loading the page. Prerendering is primarily useful for pages that are the same for all users of your application.

Because prerendering occurs at build-time, it may add significant time to your production builds. Using [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') to produce a large number of HTML documents may affect the total file size of your deployments, and thus lead to slower deployments.

Prerendering generally has excellent search engine optimization (SEO), as search crawlers receive a fully rendered HTML document.

Prerendering requires you to author code that does not strictly depend on browser APIs and limits your selection of JavaScript libraries that assume they run in a browser.

Prerendering incurs extremely little overhead per server request, as your server responds with static HTML documents. Static files are also easily cached by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), browsers, and intermediate caching layers for even faster subsequent page loads. Fully static sites can also be deployed solely through a CDN or static file server, eliminating the need to maintain a custom server runtime for your application. This enhances scalability by offloading work from an application web server, making it particularly beneficial for high-traffic applications.

NOTE: When using Angular service worker, the first request is server-rendered, but all subsequent requests are handled by the service worker and rendered client-side.

### Setting headers and status codes

You can set custom headers and status codes for individual server routes using the `headers` and `status` properties in the `ServerRoute` configuration.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'profile',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server,
    headers: {
      'X-My-Custom-Header': 'some-value',
    },
    status: 201,
  },
  // ... other routes
];
```

### Redirects

Angular handles redirects specified by the [`redirectTo`](api/router/Route#redirectTo 'API reference') property in route configurations, differently on the server-side.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
Redirects are performed using standard HTTP redirects (e.g., 301, 302) within the server-side rendering process.

**Prerendering (SSG)**
Redirects are implemented as "soft redirects" using [`<meta http-equiv="refresh">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#refresh) tags in the prerendered HTML.

### Customizing build-time prerendering (SSG)

When using [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), you can specify several configuration options to customize the prerendering and serving process.

#### Parameterized routes

For each route with [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), you can specify a [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') function. This function lets you control which specific parameters produce separate prerendered documents.

The [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of objects. Each object is a key-value map of route parameter name to value. For example, if you define a route like `posts/:id`, `getPrerenderParams ` could return the array `[{id: 123}, {id: 456}]`, and thus render separate documents for `posts/123` and `posts/456`.

The body of [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') can use Angular's [`inject`](api/core/inject 'API reference') function to inject dependencies and perform any work to determine which routes to prerender. This typically includes making requests to fetch data to construct the array of parameter values.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
    async getPrerenderParams() {
      const dataService = inject(PostService);
      const ids = await dataService.getIds(); // Assuming this returns ['1', '2', '3']

      return ids.map(id => ({ id })); // Transforms IDs into an array of objects for prerendering

      // This will prerender the paths: `/post/1`, `/post/2` and `/post/3`
    },
  },
];
```

Because [`getPrerenderParams`](api/ssr/ServerRoutePrerenderWithParams#getPrerenderParams 'API reference') exclusively applies to [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference'), this function always runs at _build-time_. `getPrerenderParams` must not rely on any browser-specific or server-specific APIs for data.

IMPORTANT: When using [`inject`](api/core/inject 'API reference') inside `getPrerenderParams`, please remember that `inject` must be used synchronously. It cannot be invoked within asynchronous callbacks or following any `await` statements. For more information, refer to [`runInInjectionContext`](api/core/runInInjectionContext).

#### Fallback strategies

When using [`RenderMode.Prerender`](api/ssr/RenderMode#Prerender 'API reference') mode, you can specify a fallback strategy to handle requests for paths that haven't been prerendered.

The available fallback strategies are:

- **Server:** Falls back to server-side rendering. This is the **default** behavior if no `fallback` property is specified.
- **Client:** Falls back to client-side rendering.
- **None:** No fallback. Angular will not handle requests for paths that are not prerendered.

```typescript
// app.routes.server.ts
import { RenderMode, PrerenderFallback, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';

export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
    fallback: PrerenderFallback.Client, // Fallback to CSR if not prerendered
    async getPrerenderParams() {
      // This function returns an array of objects representing prerendered posts at the paths:
      // `/post/1`, `/post/2`, and `/post/3`.
      // The path `/post/4` will utilize the fallback behavior if it's requested.
      return [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }];
    },
  },
];
```

## Accessing Request and Response via DI

The `@angular/core` package provides several tokens for interacting with the server-side rendering environment. These tokens give you access to crucial information and objects within your Angular application during SSR.

- **[`REQUEST`](api/core/REQUEST 'API reference'):** Provides access to the current request object, which is of type [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) from the Web API. This allows you to access headers, cookies, and other request information.
- **[`RESPONSE_INIT`](api/core/RESPONSE_INIT 'API reference'):** Provides access to the response initialization options, which is of type [`ResponseInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#parameters) from the Web API. This allows you to set headers and the status code for the response dynamically. Use this token to set headers or status codes that need to be determined at runtime.
- **[`REQUEST_CONTEXT`](api/core/REQUEST_CONTEXT 'API reference'):** Provides access to additional context related to the current request. This context can be passed as the second parameter of the [`handle`](api/ssr/AngularAppEngine#handle 'API reference') function. Typically, this is used to provide additional request-related information that is not part of the standard Web API.

```angular-ts
import { inject, REQUEST } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `<h1>My Component</h1>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor() {
    const request = inject(REQUEST);
    console.log(request?.url);
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: The above tokens will be `null` in the following scenarios:
- During the build processes.
- When the application is rendered in the browser (CSR).
- When performing static site generation (SSG).
- During route extraction in development (at the time of the request).

## Configuring a server

### Node.js

The `@angular/ssr/node` extends `@angular/ssr` specifically for Node.js environments. It provides APIs that make it easier to implement server-side rendering within your Node.js application. For a complete list of functions and usage examples, refer to the [`@angular/ssr/node` API reference](api/ssr/node/AngularNodeAppEngine) API reference.

```typescript
// server.ts
import { AngularNodeAppEngine, createNodeRequestHandler, writeResponseToNodeResponse } from '@angular/ssr/node';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const angularApp = new AngularNodeAppEngine();

app.use('*', (req, res, next) => {
  angularApp
    .handle(req)
    .then(response => {
      if (response) {
        writeResponseToNodeResponse(response, res);
      } else {
        next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
      }
    })
    .catch(next);
});

/**
 * The request handler used by the Angular CLI (dev-server and during build).
 */
export const reqHandler = createNodeRequestHandler(app);
```

### Non-Node.js

The `@angular/ssr` provides essential APIs for server-side rendering your Angular application on platforms other than Node.js. It leverages the standard [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects from the Web API, enabling you to integrate Angular SSR into various server environments. For detailed information and examples, refer to the [`@angular/ssr` API reference](api/ssr/AngularAppEngine).

```typescript
// server.ts
import { AngularAppEngine, createRequestHandler } from '@angular/ssr';

const angularApp = new AngularAppEngine();

/**
 * This is a request handler used by the Angular CLI (dev-server and during build).
 */
export const reqHandler = createRequestHandler(async (req: Request) => {
  const res: Response|null = await angularApp.render(req);

  // ...
});
```

## Generate a fully static application

By default, Angular prerenders your entire application and generates a server file for handling requests. This allows your app to serve pre-rendered content to users. However, if you prefer a fully static site without a server, you can opt out of this behavior by setting the `outputMode` to `static` in your `angular.json` configuration file.

When `outputMode` is set to `static`, Angular generates pre-rendered HTML files for each route at build time, but it does not generate a server file or require a Node.js server to serve the app. This is useful for deploying to static hosting providers where a backend server is not needed.

To configure this, update your `angular.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-app": {
      "architect": {
        "prerender": {
          "options": {
            "outputMode": "static"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Caching data when using HttpClient

[`HttpClient`](api/common/http/HttpClient) cached outgoing network requests when running on the server. This information is serialized and transferred to the browser as part of the initial HTML sent from the server. In the browser, `HttpClient` checks whether it has data in the cache and if so, reuses it instead of making a new HTTP request during initial application rendering. `HttpClient` stops using the cache once an application becomes [stable](api/core/ApplicationRef#isStable) while running in a browser.

By default, `HttpClient` caches all `HEAD` and `GET` requests which don't contain `Authorization` or `Proxy-Authorization` headers. You can override those settings by using [`withHttpTransferCacheOptions`](api/platform-browser/withHttpTransferCacheOptions) when providing hydration.

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideClientHydration(withHttpTransferCacheOptions({
      includePostRequests: true
    }))
  ]
});
```

## Authoring server-compatible components

Some common browser APIs and capabilities might not be available on the server. Applications cannot make use of browser-specific global objects like `window`, `document`, `navigator`, or `location` as well as certain properties of `HTMLElement`.

In general, code which relies on browser-specific symbols should only be executed in the browser, not on the server. This can be enforced through the [`afterRender`](api/core/afterRender) and [`afterNextRender`](api/core/afterNextRender) lifecycle hooks. These are only executed on the browser and skipped on the server.

```angular-ts
import { Component, ViewChild, afterNextRender } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-cmp',
  template: `<span #content>{{ ... }}</span>`,
})
export class MyComponent {
  @ViewChild('content') contentRef: ElementRef;

  constructor() {
    afterNextRender(() => {
      // Safe to check `scrollHeight` because this will only run in the browser, not the server.
      console.log('content height: ' + this.contentRef.nativeElement.scrollHeight);
    });
  }
}
```



================================================

================================================
# Angular without ZoneJS (Zoneless)

## Why use Zoneless?

The main advantages to removing ZoneJS as a dependency are:

- **Improved performance**: ZoneJS uses DOM events and async tasks as indicators of when application state _might_ have updated and subsequently triggers application synchronization to run change detection on the application's views. ZoneJS does not have any insight into whether application state actually changed and so this synchronization is triggered more frequently than necessary.
- **Improved Core Web Vitals**: ZoneJS brings a fair amount of overhead, both in payload size and in startup time cost.
- **Improved debugging experience**: ZoneJS makes debugging code more difficult. Stack traces are harder to understand with ZoneJS. It's also difficult to understand when code breaks as a result of being outside the Angular Zone.
- **Better ecosystem compatibility**: ZoneJS works by patching browser APIs but does not automatically have patches for every new browser API. Some APIs cannot be patched effectively, such as `async`/`await`, and have to be downleveled to work with ZoneJS. Sometimes libraries in the ecosystem are also incompatible with the way ZoneJS patches the native APIs. Removing ZoneJS as a dependency ensures better long-term compatibility by removing a source of complexity, monkey patching, and ongoing maintenance.

## Enabling Zoneless in an application

The API for enabling Zoneless is currently experimental. Neither the shape, nor the underlying behavior is stable and can change
in patch versions. There are known feature gaps, including the lack of an ergonomic API which prevents the application from serializing too early with Server Side Rendering.

```typescript
// standalone bootstrap
bootstrapApplication(MyApp, {providers: [
  provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(),
]});

// NgModule bootstrap
platformBrowser().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
@NgModule({
  providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Removing ZoneJS

Zoneless applications should remove ZoneJS entirely from the build to reduce bundle size. ZoneJS is typically
loaded via the `polyfills` option in `angular.json`, both in the `build` and `test` targets. Remove `zone.js`
and `zone.js/testing` from both to remove it from the build. Projects which use an explicit `polyfills.ts` file
should remove `import 'zone.js';` and `import 'zone.js/testing';` from the file.

After removing ZoneJS from the build, there is no longer a need for a `zone.js` dependency either and the
package can be removed entirely:

```shell
npm uninstall zone.js
```

## Requirements for Zoneless compatibility

Angular relies on notifications from core APIs in order to determine when to run change detection and on which views.
These notifications include:

- `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck` (called automatically by `AsyncPipe`)
- `ComponentRef.setInput`
- Updating a signal that's read in a template
- Bound host or template listeners callbacks
- Attaching a view that was marked dirty by one of the above

### `OnPush`-compatible components

One way to ensure that a component is using the correct notification mechanisms from above is to
use [ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush](/best-practices/skipping-subtrees#using-onpush).

The `OnPush` change detection strategy is not required, but it is a recommended step towards zoneless compatibility for application components. It is not always possible for library components to use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
When a library component is a host for user-components which might use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`, it cannot use `OnPush` because that would prevent the child component from being refreshed if it is not `OnPush` compatible and relies on ZoneJS to trigger change detection. Components can use the `Default` strategy as long as they notify Angular when change detection needs to run (calling `markForCheck`, using signals, `AsyncPipe`, etc.).
Being a host for a user component means using an API such as `ViewContainerRef.createComponent` and not just hosting a portion of a template from a user component (i.e. content projection or a using a template ref input).

### Remove `NgZone.onMicrotaskEmpty`, `NgZone.onUnstable`, `NgZone.isStable`, or `NgZone.onStable`

Applications and libraries need to remove uses of `NgZone.onMicrotaskEmpty`, `NgZone.onUnstable` and `NgZone.onStable`.
These observables will never emit when an Application enables zoneless change detection.
Similarly, `NgZone.isStable` will always be `true` and should not be used as a condition for code execution.

The `NgZone.onMicrotaskEmpty` and `NgZone.onStable` observables are most often used to wait for Angular to
complete change detection before performing a task. Instead, these can be replaced by `afterNextRender`
if they need to wait for a single change detection or `afterRender` if there is some condition that might span
several change detection rounds. In other cases, these observables were used because they happened to be
familiar and have similar timing to what was needed. More straightforward or direct DOM APIs can be used instead,
such as `MutationObserver` when code needs to wait for certain DOM state (rather than waiting for it indirectly
through Angular's render hooks).

<docs-callout title="NgZone.run and NgZone.runOutsideAngular are compatible with Zoneless">
`NgZone.run` and `NgZone.runOutsideAngular` do not need to be removed in order for code to be compatible with
Zoneless applications. In fact, removing these calls can lead to performance regressions for libraries that
are used in applications that still rely on ZoneJS.
</docs-callout>

### `PendingTasks` for Server Side Rendering (SSR)

If you are using SSR with Angular, you may know that it relies on ZoneJS to help determine when the application
is "stable" and can be serialized. If there are asynchronous tasks that should prevent serialization, an application
not using ZoneJS must make Angular aware of these with the [PendingTasks](/api/core/PendingTasks) service. Serialization
will wait for the first moment that all pending tasks have been removed.


The two most straightforward uses of pending tasks are the `run` method:

```typescript
const taskService = inject(PendingTasks);
taskService.run(async () => {
  const someResult = await doSomeWorkThatNeedsToBeRendered();
  this.someState.set(someResult);
});
```

For more complicated use-cases, you can manuall add and remove a pending tasks:

```typescript
const taskService = inject(PendingTasks);
const taskCleanup = taskService.add();
try {
  await doSomeWorkThatNeedsToBeRendered();
} catch {
  // handle error
} finally {
  taskCleanup();
}
```

In addition, the [pendingUntilEvent](/api/core/rxjs-interop/pendingUntilEvent#) helper in `rxjs-interop` ensures
the application remains unstable until the observable emits, complets, errors, or is unsubscribed.

```typescript
readonly myObservableState = someObservable.pipe(pendingUntilEvent());
```

The framework uses this service internally as well to prevent serialization until asynchronous tasks are complete. These include, but are not limited to,
an ongoing Router navigation and an incomplete `HttpClient` request.

## Testing and Debugging

### Using Zoneless in `TestBed`

The zoneless provider function can also be used with `TestBed` to help
ensure the components under test are compatible with a Zoneless
Angular application.

```typescript
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()]
});

const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);
await fixture.whenStable();
```

To ensure tests have the most similar behavior to production code,
avoid using `fixture.detectChanges()` when possible. This forces
change detection to run when Angular might otherwise have not
scheduled change detection. Tests should ensure these notifications
are happening and allow Angular to handle when to synchronize
state rather than manually forcing it to happen in the test.

For existing test suites, using `fixture.detectChanges()` is a common pattern
and it is likely not worth the effort of converting these to
`await fixture.whenStable()`. `TestBed` will still enforce that the
fixture's component is `OnPush` compatible and throws `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`
if it finds that template values were updated without a
change notification (i.e. `fixture.componentInstance.someValue = 'newValue';`).
If the component is used in production, this issue should be addressed by updating
the component to use signals for state or call `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`.
If the component is only used as a test wrapper and never used in an application,
it is acceptable to use `fixture.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`.

### Debug-mode check to ensure updates are detected

Angular also provides an additional tool to help verify that an application is making
updates to state in a zoneless-compatible way. `provideExperimentalCheckNoChangesForDebug`
can be used to periodically check to ensure that no bindings have been updated
without a notification. Angular throws `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`
if there is an updated binding that would not have refreshed by the zoneless change
detection.

# Complex animation sequences

So far, we've learned simple animations of single HTML elements.
Angular also lets you animate coordinated sequences, such as an entire grid or list of elements as they enter and leave a page.
You can choose to run multiple animations in parallel, or run discrete animations sequentially, one following another.

The functions that control complex animation sequences are:

| Functions                         | Details |
|:---                               |:---     |
| `query()`                         | Finds one or more inner HTML elements. |
| `stagger()`                       | Applies a cascading delay to animations for multiple elements. |
| [`group()`](api/animations/group) | Runs multiple animation steps in parallel. |
| `sequence()`                      | Runs animation steps one after another. |

## The query() function

Most complex animations rely on the `query()` function to find child elements and apply animations to them, basic examples of such are:

| Examples                               | Details |
|:---                                    |:---     |
| `query()` followed by `animate()`      | Used to query simple HTML elements and directly apply animations to them.                                                                                                                            |
| `query()` followed by `animateChild()` | Used to query child elements, which themselves have animations metadata applied to them and trigger such animation \(which would be otherwise be blocked by the current/parent element's animation\). |

The first argument of `query()` is a [css selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) string which can also contain the following Angular-specific tokens:

| Tokens                     | Details |
|:---                        |:---     |
| `:enter` <br /> `:leave`   | For entering/leaving elements.               |

<docs-callout title="Entering and Leaving Elements">

Not all child elements are actually considered as entering/leaving; this can, at times, be counterintuitive and confusing. Please see the [query api docs](api/animations/query#entering-and-leaving-elements) for more information.

You can also see an illustration of this in the animations example \(introduced in the animations [introduction section](guide/animations#about-this-guide)\) under the Querying tab.

</docs-callout>

## Animate multiple elements using query() and stagger() functions

After having queried child elements via `query()`, the `stagger()` function lets you define a timing gap between each queried item that is animated and thus animates elements with a delay between them.

The following example demonstrates how to use the `query()` and `stagger()` functions to animate a list \(of heroes\) adding each in sequence, with a slight delay, from top to bottom.

* Use `query()` to look for an element entering the page that meets certain criteria
* For each of these elements, use `style()` to set the same initial style for the element.
    Make it transparent and use `transform` to move it out of position so that it can slide into place.

* Use `stagger()` to delay each animation by 30 milliseconds
* Animate each element on screen for 0.5 seconds using a custom-defined easing curve, simultaneously fading it in and un-transforming it

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" visibleRegion="page-animations"/>

## Parallel animation using group() function

You've seen how to add a delay between each successive animation.
But you might also want to configure animations that happen in parallel.
For example, you might want to animate two CSS properties of the same element but use a different `easing` function for each one.
For this, you can use the animation [`group()`](api/animations/group) function.

HELPFUL: The [`group()`](api/animations/group) function is used to group animation *steps*, rather than animated elements.

The following example uses [`group()`](api/animations/group)s on both `:enter` and `:leave` for two different timing configurations, thus applying two independent animations to the same element in parallel.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-groups.component.ts (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-groups.component.ts" visibleRegion="animationdef"/>

## Sequential vs. parallel animations

Complex animations can have many things happening at once.
But what if you want to create an animation involving several animations happening one after the other? Earlier you used [`group()`](api/animations/group) to run multiple animations all at the same time, in parallel.

A second function called `sequence()` lets you run those same animations one after the other.
Within `sequence()`, the animation steps consist of either `style()` or `animate()` function calls.

* Use `style()` to apply the provided styling data immediately.
* Use `animate()` to apply styling data over a given time interval.

## Filter animation example

Take a look at another animation on the example page.
Under the Filter/Stagger tab, enter some text into the **Search Heroes** text box, such as `Magnet` or `tornado`.

The filter works in real time as you type.
Elements leave the page as you type each new letter and the filter gets progressively stricter.
The heroes list gradually re-enters the page as you delete each letter in the filter box.

The HTML template contains a trigger called `filterAnimation`.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-page.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-page.component.html" visibleRegion="filter-animations" language="angular-html"/>

The `filterAnimation` in the component's decorator contains three transitions.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" visibleRegion="filter-animations"/>

The code in this example performs the following tasks:

* Skips animations when the user first opens or navigates to this page \(the filter animation narrows what is already there, so it only works on elements that already exist in the DOM\)
* Filters heroes based on the search input's value

For each change:

* Hides an element leaving the DOM by setting its opacity and width to 0
* Animates an element entering the DOM over 300 milliseconds.
    During the animation, the element assumes its default width and opacity.

* If there are multiple elements entering or leaving the DOM, staggers each animation starting at the top of the page, with a 50-millisecond delay between each element

## Animating the items of a reordering list

Although Angular animates correctly `*ngFor` list items out of the box, it will not be able to do so if their ordering changes.
This is because it will lose track of which element is which, resulting in broken animations.
The only way to help Angular keep track of such elements is by assigning a `TrackByFunction` to the `NgForOf` directive.
This makes sure that Angular always knows which element is which, thus allowing it to apply the correct animations to the correct elements all the time.

IMPORTANT: If you need to animate the items of an `*ngFor` list and there is a possibility that the order of such items will change during runtime, always use a `TrackByFunction`.

## Animations and Component View Encapsulation

Angular animations are based on the components DOM structure and do not directly take [View Encapsulation](guide/components/styling#style-scoping) into account, this means that components using `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` behave exactly as if they were using `ViewEncapsulation.None` (`ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` behaves differently as we'll discuss shortly).

For example if the `query()` function (which you'll see more of in the rest of the Animations guide) were to be applied at the top of a tree of components using the emulated view encapsulation, such query would be able to identify (and thus animate) DOM elements on any depth of the tree.

On the other hand the `ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom` changes the component's DOM structure by "hiding" DOM elements inside [`ShadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) elements. Such DOM manipulations do prevent some of the animations implementation to work properly since it relies on simple DOM structures and doesn't take `ShadowRoot` elements into account. Therefore it is advised to avoid applying animations to views incorporating components using the ShadowDom view encapsulation.

## Animation sequence summary

Angular functions for animating multiple elements start with `query()` to find inner elements; for example, gathering all images within a `<div>`.
The remaining functions, `stagger()`, [`group()`](api/animations/group), and `sequence()`, apply cascades or let you control how multiple animation steps are applied.

# Introduction to Angular animations

Animation provides the illusion of motion: HTML elements change styling over time.
Well-designed animations can make your application more fun and straightforward to use, but they aren't just cosmetic.
Animations can improve your application and user experience in a number of ways:

* Without animations, web page transitions can seem abrupt and jarring
* Motion greatly enhances the user experience, so animations give users a chance to detect the application's response to their actions
* Good animations intuitively call the user's attention to where it is needed

Typically, animations involve multiple style *transformations* over time.
An HTML element can move, change color, grow or shrink, fade, or slide off the page.
These changes can occur simultaneously or sequentially. You can control the timing of each transformation.

Angular's animation system is built on CSS functionality, which means you can animate any property that the browser considers animatable.
This includes positions, sizes, transforms, colors, borders, and more.
The W3C maintains a list of animatable properties on its [CSS Transitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions-1) page.

## About this guide

This guide covers the basic Angular animation features to get you started on adding Angular animations to your project.

## Getting started

The main Angular modules for animations are `@angular/animations` and `@angular/platform-browser`.

To get started with adding Angular animations to your project, import the animation-specific modules along with standard Angular functionality.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Enabling the animations module">
Import `provideAnimationsAsync` from `@angular/platform-browser/animations/async` and add it to the providers list in the `bootstrapApplication` function call.

<docs-code header="Enabling Animations" language="ts" linenums>
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideAnimationsAsync(),
  ]
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="If you need immediate animations in your application">
  If you need to have an animation happen immediately when your application is loaded,
  you will want to switch to the eagerly loaded animations module. Import `provideAnimations`
  from `@angular/platform-browser/animations` instead, and use `provideAnimations` **in place of**
  `provideAnimationsAsync` in the `bootstrapApplication` function call.
</docs-callout>

For `NgModule` based applications import `BrowserAnimationsModule`, which introduces the animation capabilities into your Angular root application module.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.module.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/app.module.1.ts"/>
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Importing animation functions into component files">
If you plan to use specific animation functions in component files, import those functions from `@angular/animations`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="imports"/>

See all [available animation functions](guide/animations#animations-api-summary) at the end of this guide.

</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Adding the animation metadata property">
In the component file, add a metadata property called `animations:` within the `@Component()` decorator.
You put the trigger that defines an animation within the `animations` metadata property.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="decorator"/>
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

## Animating a transition

Let's animate a transition that changes a single HTML element from one state to another.
For example, you can specify that a button displays either **Open** or **Closed** based on the user's last action.
When the button is in the `open` state, it's visible and yellow.
When it's the `closed` state, it's translucent and blue.

In HTML, these attributes are set using ordinary CSS styles such as color and opacity.
In Angular, use the `style()` function to specify a set of CSS styles for use with animations.
Collect a set of styles in an animation state, and give the state a name, such as `open` or `closed`.

HELPFUL: Let's create a new `open-close` component to animate with simple transitions.

Run the following command in terminal to generate the component:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng g component open-close

</docs-code>

This will create the component at `src/app/open-close.component.ts`.

### Animation state and styles

Use Angular's [`state()`](api/animations/state) function to define different states to call at the end of each transition.
This function takes two arguments:
A unique name like `open` or `closed` and a `style()` function.

Use the `style()` function to define a set of styles to associate with a given state name.
You must use *camelCase* for style attributes that contain dashes, such as `backgroundColor` or wrap them in quotes, such as `'background-color'`.

Let's see how Angular's [`state()`](api/animations/state) function works with the `style⁣­(⁠)` function to set CSS style attributes.
In this code snippet, multiple style attributes are set at the same time for the state.
In the `open` state, the button has a height of 200 pixels, an opacity of 1, and a yellow background color.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="state1"/>

In the following `closed` state, the button has a height of 100 pixels, an opacity of 0.8, and a background color of blue.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="state2"/>

### Transitions and timing

In Angular, you can set multiple styles without any animation.
However, without further refinement, the button instantly transforms with no fade, no shrinkage, or other visible indicator that a change is occurring.

To make the change less abrupt, you need to define an animation *transition* to specify the changes that occur between one state and another over a period of time.
The `transition()` function accepts two arguments:
The first argument accepts an expression that defines the direction between two transition states, and the second argument accepts one or a series of `animate()` steps.

Use the `animate()` function to define the length, delay, and easing of a transition, and to designate the style function for defining styles while transitions are taking place.
Use the `animate()` function to define the `keyframes()` function for multi-step animations.
These definitions are placed in the second argument of the `animate()` function.

#### Animation metadata: duration, delay, and easing

The `animate()` function \(second argument of the transition function\) accepts the `timings` and `styles` input parameters.

The `timings` parameter takes either a number or a string defined in three parts.

<docs-code language="typescript">

animate (duration)

</docs-code>

or

<docs-code language="typescript">

animate ('duration delay easing')

</docs-code>

The first part, `duration`, is required.
The duration can be expressed in milliseconds as a number without quotes, or in seconds with quotes and a time specifier.
For example, a duration of a tenth of a second can be expressed as follows:

* As a plain number, in milliseconds:
    `100`

* In a string, as milliseconds:
    `'100ms'`

* In a string, as seconds:
    `'0.1s'`

The second argument, `delay`, has the same syntax as `duration`.
For example:

* Wait for 100ms and then run for 200ms: `'0.2s 100ms'`

The third argument, `easing`, controls how the animation [accelerates and decelerates](https://easings.net) during its runtime.
For example, `ease-in` causes the animation to begin slowly, and to pick up speed as it progresses.

* Wait for 100ms, run for 200ms.
    Use a deceleration curve to start out fast and slowly decelerate to a resting point:
    `'0.2s 100ms ease-out'`

* Run for 200ms, with no delay.
    Use a standard curve to start slow, accelerate in the middle, and then decelerate slowly at the end:
    `'0.2s ease-in-out'`

* Start immediately, run for 200ms.
    Use an acceleration curve to start slow and end at full velocity:
    `'0.2s ease-in'`

HELPFUL: See the Material Design website's topic on [Natural easing curves](https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing) for general information on easing curves.

This example provides a state transition from `open` to `closed` with a 1-second transition between states.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="transition1"/>

In the preceding code snippet, the `=>` operator indicates unidirectional transitions, and `<=>` is bidirectional.
Within the transition, `animate()` specifies how long the transition takes.
In this case, the state change from `open` to `closed` takes 1 second, expressed here as `1s`.

This example adds a state transition from the `closed` state to the `open` state with a 0.5-second transition animation arc.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="transition2"/>

HELPFUL: Some additional notes on using styles within [`state`](api/animations/state) and `transition` functions.

* Use [`state()`](api/animations/state) to define styles that are applied at the end of each transition, they persist after the animation completes
* Use `transition()` to define intermediate styles, which create the illusion of motion during the animation
* When animations are disabled, `transition()` styles can be skipped, but [`state()`](api/animations/state) styles can't
* Include multiple state pairs within the same `transition()` argument:

    <docs-code language="typescript">

    transition( 'on => off, off => void' )

    </docs-code>

### Triggering the animation

An animation requires a *trigger*, so that it knows when to start.
The `trigger()` function collects the states and transitions, and gives the animation a name, so that you can attach it to the triggering element in the HTML template.

The `trigger()` function describes the property name to watch for changes.
When a change occurs, the trigger initiates the actions included in its definition.
These actions can be transitions or other functions, as we'll see later on.

In this example, we'll name the trigger `openClose`, and attach it to the `button` element.
The trigger describes the open and closed states, and the timings for the two transitions.

HELPFUL: Within each `trigger()` function call, an element can only be in one state at any given time.
However, it's possible for multiple triggers to be active at once.

### Defining animations and attaching them to the HTML template

Animations are defined in the metadata of the component that controls the HTML element to be animated.
Put the code that defines your animations under the `animations:` property within the `@Component()` decorator.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="component"/>

When you've defined an animation trigger for a component, attach it to an element in that component's template by wrapping the trigger name in brackets and preceding it with an `@` symbol.
Then, you can bind the trigger to a template expression using standard Angular property binding syntax as shown below, where `triggerName` is the name of the trigger, and `expression` evaluates to a defined animation state.

<docs-code language="typescript">

<div [@triggerName]="expression">…</div>;

</docs-code>

The animation is executed or triggered when the expression value changes to a new state.

The following code snippet binds the trigger to the value of the `isOpen` property.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.1.html" visibleRegion="trigger"/>

In this example, when the `isOpen` expression evaluates to a defined state of `open` or `closed`, it notifies the trigger `openClose` of a state change.
Then it's up to the `openClose` code to handle the state change and kick off a state change animation.

For elements entering or leaving a page \(inserted or removed from the DOM\), you can make the animations conditional.
For example, use `*ngIf` with the animation trigger in the HTML template.

HELPFUL: In the component file, set the trigger that defines the animations as the value of the `animations:` property in the `@Component()` decorator.

In the HTML template file, use the trigger name to attach the defined animations to the HTML element to be animated.

### Code review

Here are the code files discussed in the transition example.

## Animations API summary

The functional API provided by the `@angular/animations` module provides a domain-specific language \(DSL\) for creating and controlling animations in Angular applications.
See the [API reference](api#animations) for a complete listing and syntax details of the core functions and related data structures.

| Function name                     | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `transition()`                    | Defines the animation sequence between two named states. Uses array syntax.                                                                                                                                 |
| `keyframes()`                     | Allows a sequential change between styles within a specified time interval. Use within `animate()`. Can include multiple `style()` calls within each `keyframe()`. Uses array syntax.                       |
| [`group()`](api/animations/group) | Specifies a group of animation steps \(*inner animations*\) to be run in parallel. Animation continues only after all inner animation steps have completed. Used within `sequence()` or `transition()`.     |

# Reusable animations

This topic provides some examples of how to create reusable animations.

## Create reusable animations

To create a reusable animation, use the [`animation()`](api/animations/animation) function to define an animation in a separate `.ts` file and declare this animation definition as a `const` export variable.
You can then import and reuse this animation in any of your application components using the [`useAnimation()`](api/animations/useAnimation) function.

<docs-code header="src/app/animations.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/animations.1.ts" visibleRegion="animation-const"/>

In the preceding code snippet, `transitionAnimation` is made reusable by declaring it as an export variable.

HELPFUL: The `height`, `opacity`, `backgroundColor`, and `time` inputs are replaced during runtime.

You can also export a part of an animation.
For example, the following snippet exports the animation `trigger`.

<docs-code header="src/app/animations.1.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/animations.1.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-const"/>

From this point, you can import reusable animation variables in your component class.
For example, the following code snippet imports the `transitionAnimation` variable and uses it via the `useAnimation()` function.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.3.ts" visibleRegion="reusable"/>

# Route transition animations

When a user navigates from one route to another, the Angular Router maps the URL path to the relevant component and displays its view. Animating this route transition can greatly enhance the user experience. The Router has support for the View Transitions API when navigating between routes in Chrome/Chromium browsers.

HELPFUL: The Router's native View Transitions integration is currently in [developer preview](/reference/releases#developer-preview). Native View Transitions are also a relatively new feature so there may be limited support in some browsers.

## How View Transitions work

The native browser method that’s used for view transitions is `document.startViewTransition`. When `startViewTransition()` is called, the browser captures the current state of the page which includes taking a screenshot. The method takes a callback that updates the DOM and this function can be asynchronous. The new state is captured and the transition begins in the next animation frame when the promise returned by the callback resolves.

Here’s an example of the startViewTransition api:

```ts
document.startViewTransition(async () => {
  await updateTheDOMSomehow();
});
```

If you’re curious to read more about the details of the browser API, the [Chrome Explainer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions) is an invaluable resource.

## How the Router uses view transitions

Several things happen after navigation starts in the router: route matching, loading lazy routes and components, executing guards and resolvers to name a few. Once these have completed successfully, the new routes are ready to be activated. This route activation is the DOM update that we want to perform as part of the view transition.

When the view transition feature is enabled, navigation “pauses” and a call is made to the browser’s `startViewTransition` method. Once the `startViewTransition` callback executes (this happens asynchronously, as outlined in the spec here), navigation “resumes”. The remaining steps for the router navigation include updating the browser URL and activating or deactivating the matched routes (the DOM update).

Finally, the callback passed to `startViewTransition` returns a Promise that resolves once Angular has finished rendering. As described above, this indicates to the browser that the new DOM state should be captured and the transition should begin.

View transitions are a [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement). If the browser does not support the API, the Router will perform the DOM updates without calling `startViewTransition` and the navigation will not be animated.

## Enabling View Transitions in the Router

To enable this feature, simply add `withViewTransitions` to the `provideRouter` or set `enableViewTransitions: true` in `RouterModule.forRoot`:

```ts
// Standalone bootstrap
bootstrapApplication(MyApp, {providers: [
  provideRouter(ROUTES, withViewTransitions()),
]});

// NgModule bootstrap
@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {enableViewTransitions: true})]
})
export class AppRouting {}
```

[Try the “count” example on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-2dnvtm?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

This example uses the counter application from the Chrome explainer and replaces the direct call to startViewTransition when the counter increments with a router navigation.

## Using CSS to customize transitions

View transitions can be customized with CSS. We can also instruct the browser to create separate elements for the transition by setting a view-transition-name. We can expand the first example by adding view-transition-name: count to the .count style in the Counter component. Then, in the global styles, we can define a custom animation for this view transition:

```css
/* Custom transition */
@keyframes rotate-out {
 to {
   transform: rotate(90deg);
 }
}
@keyframes rotate-in {
 from {
   transform: rotate(-90deg);
 }
}
::view-transition-old(count),
::view-transition-new(count) {
 animation-duration: 200ms;
 animation-name: -ua-view-transition-fade-in, rotate-in;
}
::view-transition-old(count) {
 animation-name: -ua-view-transition-fade-out, rotate-out;
}
```

It is important that the view transition animations are defined in a global style file. They cannot be defined in the component styles because the default view encapsulation will scope the styles to the component.

[Try the updated “count” example on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-fwn4i7?file=src%2Fmain.ts)

## Controlling transitions with onViewTransitionCreated

The `withViewTransitions` router feature can also be called with an options object that includes an `onViewTransitionCreated` callback. This callback is run in an [injection context](/guide/di/dependency-injection-context#run-within-an-injection-context) and receives a [ViewTransitionInfo](/api/router/ViewTransitionInfo) object that includes the `ViewTransition` returned from `startViewTransition`, as well as the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` that the navigation is transitioning from and the new one that it is transitioning to.

This callback can be used for any number of customizations. For example, you might want to skip transitions under certain conditions. We use this on the new angular.dev docs site:

```ts
withViewTransitions({
 onViewTransitionCreated: ({transition}) => {
   const router = inject(Router);
   const targetUrl = router.getCurrentNavigation()!.finalUrl!;
   // Skip the transition if the only thing 
   // changing is the fragment and queryParams
   const config = { 
     paths: 'exact', 
     matrixParams: 'exact',
     fragment: 'ignored',
     queryParams: 'ignored',
   };

   if (router.isActive(targetUrl, config)) {
     transition.skipTransition();
   }
 },
}),
```

In this code snippet, we create a `UrlTree` from the `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` the navigation is going to. We then check with the Router to see if this `UrlTree` is already active, ignoring any differences in the fragment or query parameters. If it is already active, we call skipTransition which will skip the animation portion of the view transition. This is the case when clicking on an anchor link that will only scroll to another location in the same document.

The view transition feature in the Angular router does not provide a way to delay the animation. For the moment, our stance is that it’s always better to use the content you have rather than making the page non-interactive for any additional amount of time.

## Native View Transitions Alternative

Animating the transition between routes can also be done with the `@angular/animations` package. 
The animation [triggers and transitions](/guide/animations/transition-and-triggers)
can be derived from the router state, such as the current URL or `ActivatedRoute`.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/animations/transition-and-triggers.md
================================================
# Animation transitions and triggers

This guide goes into depth on special transition states such as the `*` wildcard and `void`. It shows how these special states are used for elements entering and leaving a view.
This section also explores multiple animation triggers, animation callbacks, and sequence-based animation using keyframes.

## Predefined states and wildcard matching

In Angular, transition states can be defined explicitly through the [`state()`](api/animations/state) function, or using the predefined `*` wildcard and `void` states.

### Wildcard state

An asterisk `*` or *wildcard* matches any animation state.
This is useful for defining transitions that apply regardless of the HTML element's start or end state.

For example, a transition of `open => *` applies when the element's state changes from open to anything else.

<img alt="wildcard state expressions" src="assets/images/guide/animations/wildcard-state-500.png">

The following is another code sample using the wildcard state together with the previous example using the `open` and `closed` states.
Instead of defining each state-to-state transition pair, any transition to `closed` takes 1 second, and any transition to `open` takes 0.5 seconds.

This allows the addition of new states without having to include separate transitions for each one.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-wildcard1"/>

Use a double arrow syntax to specify state-to-state transitions in both directions.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-wildcard2"/>

### Use wildcard state with multiple transition states

In the two-state button example, the wildcard isn't that useful because there are only two possible states, `open` and `closed`.
In general, use wildcard states when an element has multiple potential states that it can change to.
If the button can change from `open` to either `closed` or something like `inProgress`, using a wildcard state could reduce the amount of coding needed.

<img alt="wildcard state with 3 states" src="assets/images/guide/animations/wildcard-3-states.png">

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-transition"/>

The `* => *` transition applies when any change between two states takes place.

Transitions are matched in the order in which they are defined.
Thus, you can apply other transitions on top of the `* => *` transition.
For example, define style changes or animations that would apply just to `open => closed`, then use `* => *` as a fallback for state pairings that aren't otherwise called out.

To do this, list the more specific transitions *before* `* => *`.

### Use wildcards with styles

Use the wildcard `*` with a style to tell the animation to use whatever the current style value is, and animate with that.
Wildcard is a fallback value that's used if the state being animated isn't declared within the trigger.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="transition4"/>

### Void state

Use the `void` state to configure transitions for an element that is entering or leaving a page.
See [Animating entering and leaving a view](guide/animations/transition-and-triggers#aliases-enter-and-leave).

### Combine wildcard and void states

Combine wildcard and void states in a transition to trigger animations that enter and leave the page:

* A transition of `* => void` applies when the element leaves a view, regardless of what state it was in before it left
* A transition of `void => *` applies when the element enters a view, regardless of what state it assumes when entering
* The wildcard state `*` matches to *any* state, including `void`

## Animate entering and leaving a view

This section shows how to animate elements entering or leaving a page.

Add a new behavior:

* When you add a hero to the list of heroes, it appears to fly onto the page from the left
* When you remove a hero from the list, it appears to fly out to the right

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-enter-leave.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-enter-leave.component.ts" visibleRegion="animationdef"/>

In the preceding code, you applied the `void` state when the HTML element isn't attached to a view.

## Aliases :enter and :leave

`:enter` and `:leave` are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` transitions.
These aliases are used by several animation functions.

<docs-code hideCopy language="typescript">

transition ( ':enter', [ … ] );  // alias for void => *
transition ( ':leave', [ … ] );  // alias for * => void

</docs-code>

It's harder to target an element that is entering a view because it isn't in the DOM yet.
Use the aliases `:enter` and `:leave` to target HTML elements that are inserted or removed from a view.

### Use `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` with :enter and :leave

The `:enter` transition runs when any `*ngIf` or `*ngFor` views are placed on the page, and `:leave` runs when those views are removed from the page.

IMPORTANT: Entering/leaving behaviors can sometime be confusing.
As a rule of thumb consider that any element being added to the DOM by Angular passes via the `:enter` transition. Only elements being directly removed from the DOM by Angular pass via the `:leave` transition. For example, an element's view is removed from the DOM because its parent is being removed from the DOM.

This example has a special trigger for the enter and leave animation called `myInsertRemoveTrigger`.
The HTML template contains the following code.

<docs-code header="src/app/insert-remove.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/insert-remove.component.html" visibleRegion="insert-remove"/>

In the component file, the `:enter` transition sets an initial opacity of 0. It then animates it to change that opacity to 1 as the element is inserted into the view.

<docs-code header="src/app/insert-remove.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/insert-remove.component.ts" visibleRegion="enter-leave-trigger"/>

Note that this example doesn't need to use [`state()`](api/animations/state).

## Transition :increment and :decrement

The `transition()` function takes other selector values, `:increment` and `:decrement`.
Use these to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.

HELPFUL: The following example uses `query()` and `stagger()` methods.
For more information on these methods, see the [complex sequences](guide/animations/complex-sequences) page.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-page.component.ts" visibleRegion="increment"/>

## Boolean values in transitions

If a trigger contains a Boolean value as a binding value, then this value can be matched using a `transition()` expression that compares `true` and `false`, or `1` and `0`.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.2.html" visibleRegion="trigger-boolean"/>

In the code snippet above, the HTML template binds a `<div>` element to a trigger named `openClose` with a status expression of `isOpen`, and with possible values of `true` and `false`.
This pattern is an alternative to the practice of creating two named states like `open` and `close`.

Inside the `@Component` metadata under the `animations:` property, when the state evaluates to `true`, the associated HTML element's height is a wildcard style or default.
In this case, the animation uses whatever height the element already had before the animation started.
When the element is `closed`, the element gets animated to a height of 0, which makes it invisible.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-boolean"/>

## Multiple animation triggers

You can define more than one animation trigger for a component.
Attach animation triggers to different elements, and the parent-child relationships among the elements affect how and when the animations run.

### Parent-child animations

Each time an animation is triggered in Angular, the parent animation always gets priority and child animations are blocked.
For a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements containing child animations. It then lets the animations run using the [`animateChild()`](api/animations/animateChild) function.

#### Disable an animation on an HTML element

A special animation control binding called `@.disabled` can be placed on an HTML element to turn off animations on that element, as well as any nested elements.
When true, the `@.disabled` binding prevents all animations from rendering.

The following code sample shows how to use this feature.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.4.html" visibleRegion="toggle-animation"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.4.ts" visibleRegion="toggle-animation" language="typescript"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

When the `@.disabled` binding is true, the `@childAnimation` trigger doesn't kick off.

When an element within an HTML template has animations turned off using the `@.disabled` host binding, animations are turned off on all inner elements as well.
You can't selectively turn off multiple animations on a single element.<!-- vale off -->

A selective child animations can still be run on a disabled parent in one of the following ways:

* A parent animation can use the [`query()`](api/animations/query) function to collect inner elements located in disabled areas of the HTML template.
    Those elements can still animate.
<!-- vale on -->

* A child animation can be queried by a parent and then later animated with the `animateChild()` function

#### Disable all animations

To turn off all animations for an Angular application, place the `@.disabled` host binding on the topmost Angular component.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="toggle-app-animations"/>

HELPFUL: Disabling animations application-wide is useful during end-to-end \(E2E\) testing.

## Animation callbacks

The animation `trigger()` function emits *callbacks* when it starts and when it finishes.
The following example features a component that contains an `openClose` trigger.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="events1"/>

In the HTML template, the animation event is passed back via `$event`, as `@triggerName.start` and `@triggerName.done`, where `triggerName` is the name of the trigger being used.
In this example, the trigger `openClose` appears as follows.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.3.html" visibleRegion="callbacks"/>

A potential use for animation callbacks could be to cover for a slow API call, such as a database lookup.
For example, an **InProgress** button can be set up to have its own looping animation while the backend system operation finishes.

Another animation can be called when the current animation finishes.
For example, the button goes from the `inProgress` state to the `closed` state when the API call is completed.

An animation can influence an end user to *perceive* the operation as faster, even when it is not.

Callbacks can serve as a debugging tool, for example in conjunction with `console.warn()` to view the application's progress in a browser's Developer JavaScript Console.
The following code snippet creates console log output for the original example, a button with the two states of `open` and `closed`.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.ts" visibleRegion="events"/>

## Keyframes

To create an animation with multiple steps run in sequence, use *keyframes*.

Angular's `keyframe()` function allows several style changes within a single timing segment.
For example, the button, instead of fading, could change color several times over a single 2-second time span.

<img alt="keyframes" src="assets/images/guide/animations/keyframes-500.png">

The code for this color change might look like this.

<docs-code header="src/app/status-slider.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/status-slider.component.ts" visibleRegion="keyframes"/>

### Offset

Keyframes include an `offset` that defines the point in the animation where each style change occurs.
Offsets are relative measures from zero to one, marking the beginning and end of the animation. They should be applied to each of the keyframe steps if used at least once.

Defining offsets for keyframes is optional.
If you omit them, evenly spaced offsets are automatically assigned.
For example, three keyframes without predefined offsets receive offsets of 0, 0.5, and 1.
Specifying an offset of 0.8 for the middle transition in the preceding example might look like this.

<img alt="keyframes with offset" src="assets/images/guide/animations/keyframes-offset-500.png">

The code with offsets specified would be as follows.

<docs-code header="src/app/status-slider.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/status-slider.component.ts" visibleRegion="keyframesWithOffsets"/>

You can combine keyframes with `duration`, `delay`, and `easing` within a single animation.

### Keyframes with a pulsation

Use keyframes to create a pulse effect in your animations by defining styles at specific offset throughout the animation.

Here's an example of using keyframes to create a pulse effect:

* The original `open` and `closed` states, with the original changes in height, color, and opacity, occurring over a timeframe of 1 second
* A keyframes sequence inserted in the middle that causes the button to appear to pulsate irregularly over the course of that same 1 second timeframe

<img alt="keyframes with irregular pulsation" src="assets/images/guide/animations/keyframes-pulsation.png">

The code snippet for this animation might look like this.

<docs-code header="src/app/open-close.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/open-close.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="trigger"/>

### Animatable properties and units

Angular animations support builds on top of web animations, so you can animate any property that the browser considers animatable.
This includes positions, sizes, transforms, colors, borders, and more.
The W3C maintains a list of animatable properties on its [CSS Transitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions-1) page.

For properties with a numeric value, define a unit by providing the value as a string, in quotes, with the appropriate suffix:

* 50 pixels:
    `'50px'`

* Relative font size:
    `'3em'`

* Percentage:
    `'100%'`

You can also provide the value as a number. In such cases Angular assumes a default unit of pixels, or `px`.
Expressing 50 pixels as `50` is the same as saying `'50px'`.

HELPFUL: The string `"50"` would instead not be considered valid\).

### Automatic property calculation with wildcards

Sometimes, the value of a dimensional style property isn't known until runtime.
For example, elements often have widths and heights that depend on their content or the screen size.
These properties are often challenging to animate using CSS.

In these cases, you can use a special wildcard `*` property value under `style()`. The value of that particular style property is computed at runtime and then plugged into the animation.

The following example has a trigger called `shrinkOut`, used when an HTML element leaves the page.
The animation takes whatever height the element has before it leaves, and animates from that height to zero.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-list-auto.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/animations/src/app/hero-list-auto.component.ts" visibleRegion="auto-calc"/>

### Keyframes summary

The `keyframes()` function in Angular allows you to specify multiple interim styles within a single transition. An optional `offset` can be used to define the point in the animation where each style change should occur.

================================================
# Advanced component configuration

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

## ChangeDetectionStrategy

The `@Component` decorator accepts a `changeDetection` option that controls the component's **change
detection mode**. There are two change detection mode options.

**`ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default`** is, unsurprisingly, the default strategy. In this mode,
Angular checks whether the component's DOM needs an update whenever any activity may have occurred
application-wide. Activities that trigger this checking include user interaction, network response,
timers, and more.

**`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`** is an optional mode that reduces the amount of checking Angular
needs to perform. In this mode, the framework only checks if a component's DOM needs an update when:

- A component input has changes as a result of a binding in a template, or
- An event listener in this component runs
- The component is explicitly marked for check, via `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck` or something which wraps it, like `AsyncPipe`.

Additionally, when an OnPush component is checked, Angular _also_ checks all of its ancestor
components, traversing upwards through the application tree.

## PreserveWhitespaces

By default, Angular removes and collapses superfluous whitespace in templates, most commonly from
newlines and indentation. You can change this setting by explicitly setting `preserveWhitespaces` to
`true` in a component's metadata.

## Custom element schemas

By default, Angular throws an error when it encounters an unknown HTML element. You can
disable this behavior for a component by including `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` in the `schemas`
property in your component metadata.

```angular-ts
import {Component, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  ...,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  template: '<some-unknown-component></some-unknown-component>'
})
export class ComponentWithCustomElements { }
```

Angular does not support any other schemas at this time.

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Every component must have:

* A TypeScript class with _behaviors_ such as handling user input and fetching data from a server
* An HTML template that controls what renders into the DOM
* A [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors) that defines how the component is used in HTML

You provide Angular-specific information for a component by adding a `@Component` [decorator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) on top of the TypeScript class:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[1, 2, 3, 4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

For full details on writing Angular templates, including data binding, event handling, and control flow, see the [Templates guide](guide/templates).

The object passed to the `@Component` decorator is called the component's **metadata**. This includes the `selector`, `template`, and other properties described throughout this guide.

Components can optionally include a list of CSS styles that apply to that component's DOM:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
  styles: `img { border-radius: 50%; }`,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

By default, a component's styles only affect elements defined in that component's template. See [Styling Components](guide/components/styling) for details on Angular's approach to styling.

You can alternatively choose to write your template and styles in separate files:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[3, 4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  templateUrl: 'profile-photo.html',
  styleUrl: 'profile-photo.css',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

This can help separate the concerns of _presentation_ from _behavior_ in your project. You can choose one approach for your entire project, or you decide which to use for each component.

Both `templateUrl` and `styleUrl` are relative to the directory in which the component resides.

## Using components

### Imports in the `@Component` decorator

To use a component, [directive](guide/directives), or [pipe](guide/templates/pipes), you must add
it to the `imports` array in the `@Component` decorator:

```angular-ts
import {ProfilePhoto} from './profile-photo';

@Component({
  // Import the `ProfilePhoto` component in
  // order to use it in this component's template.
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  /* ... */
})
export class UserProfile { }
```

By default, Angular components are *standalone*, meaning that you can directly add them to the `imports` array of other components. Components created with an earlier version of Angular may instead specify `standalone: false` in their `@Component` decorator. For these components, you instead import the `NgModule` in which the component is defined. See the full [`NgModule` guide](guide/ngmodules) for details.

Important: In Angular versions before 19.0.0, the `standalone` option defaults to `false`.

### Showing components in a template

Every component defines a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors):

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  ...
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

See [Component Selectors](guide/components/selectors) for details about which types of selectors Angular supports and guidance on choosing a selector.

You show a component by creating a matching HTML element in the template of _other_ components:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[8]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }

@Component({
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

Angular creates an instance of the component for every matching HTML element it encounters. The DOM element that matches a component's selector is referred to as that component's **host element**. The contents of a component's template are rendered inside its host element.

The DOM rendered by a component, corresponding to that component's template, is called that
component's **view**.

In composing components in this way, **you can think of your Angular application as a tree of components**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AccountSettings]-->B
    A-->C
    B[UserProfile]-->D
    B-->E
    C[PaymentInfo]
    D[ProfilePic]
    E[UserBio]
```


This tree structure is important to understanding several other Angular concepts, including [dependency injection](guide/di) and [child queries](guide/components/queries).

================================================
# Content projection with ng-content

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

You often need to create components that act as containers for different types of content. For
example, you may want to create a custom card component:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: '<div class="card-shadow"> <!-- card content goes here --> </div>',
})
export class CustomCard {/* ... */}
```

**You can use the `<ng-content>` element as a placeholder to mark where content should go**:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: '<div class="card-shadow"> <ng-content></ng-content> </div>',
})
export class CustomCard {/* ... */}
```

TIP: `<ng-content>` works similarly
to [the native `<slot>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot),
but with some Angular-specific functionality.

When you use a component with `<ng-content>`, any children of the component host element are
rendered, or **projected**, at the location of that `<ng-content>`:

```angular-ts
// Component source
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: `
    <div class="card-shadow">
      <ng-content />
    </div>
  `,
})
export class CustomCard {/* ... */}
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<custom-card>
  <p>This is the projected content</p>
</custom-card>
```

```angular-html
<!-- The rendered DOM -->
<custom-card>
  <div class="card-shadow">
    <p>This is the projected content</p>
  </div>
</custom-card>
```

Angular refers to any children of a component passed this way as that component's **content**. This
is distinct from the component's **view**, which refers to the elements defined in the component's
template.

**The `<ng-content>` element is neither a component nor DOM element**. Instead, it is a special
placeholder that tells Angular where to render content. Angular's compiler processes
all `<ng-content>` elements at build-time. You cannot insert, remove, or modify `<ng-content>` at
run time. You cannot add directives, styles, or arbitrary attributes to `<ng-content>`.

You should not conditionally include `<ng-content>` with `@if`, `@for`, or `@switch`. Angular always
instantiates and creates DOM nodes for content rendered to a `<ng-content>` placeholder, even if
that `<ng-content>` placeholder is hidden. For conditional rendering of component content,
see [Template fragments](api/core/ng-template).

## Multiple content placeholders

Angular supports projecting multiple different elements into different `<ng-content>` placeholders
based on CSS selector. Expanding the card example from above, you could create two placeholders for
a card title and a card body by using the `select` attribute:

```angular-html
<!-- Component template -->
<div class="card-shadow">
  <ng-content select="card-title"></ng-content>
  <div class="card-divider"></div>
  <ng-content select="card-body"></ng-content>
</div>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<custom-card>
  <card-title>Hello</card-title>
  <card-body>Welcome to the example</card-body>
</custom-card>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<custom-card>
  <div class="card-shadow">
    <card-title>Hello</card-title>
    <div class="card-divider"></div>
    <card-body>Welcome to the example</card-body>
  </div>
</custom-card>
```

The `<ng-content>` placeholder supports the same CSS selectors
as [component selectors](guide/components/selectors).

If you include one or more `<ng-content>` placeholders with a `select` attribute and
one `<ng-content>` placeholder without a `select` attribute, the latter captures all elements that
did not match a `select` attribute:

```angular-html
<!-- Component template -->
<div class="card-shadow">
  <ng-content select="card-title"></ng-content>
  <div class="card-divider"></div>
  <!-- capture anything except "card-title" -->
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<custom-card>
  <card-title>Hello</card-title>
  <img src="..." />
  <p>Welcome to the example</p>
</custom-card>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<custom-card>
  <div class="card-shadow">
    <card-title>Hello</card-title>
    <div class="card-divider"></div>
    <img src="..." />
    <p>Welcome to the example</p>
  </div>
</custom-card>
```

If a component does not include an `<ng-content>` placeholder without a `select` attribute, any
elements that don't match one of the component's placeholders do not render into the DOM.

## Fallback content

Angular can show *fallback content* for a component's `<ng-content>` placeholder if that component doesn't have any matching child content. You can specify fallback content by adding child content to the `<ng-content>` element itself.

```angular-html
<!-- Component template -->
<div class="card-shadow">
  <ng-content select="card-title">Default Title</ng-content>
  <div class="card-divider"></div>
  <ng-content select="card-body">Default Body</ng-content>
</div>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<custom-card>
  <card-title>Hello</card-title>
  <!-- No card-body provided -->
</custom-card>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<custom-card>
  <div class="card-shadow">
    Hello
    <div class="card-divider"></div>
    Default Body
  </div>
</custom-card>
```

## Aliasing content for projection

Angular supports a special attribute, `ngProjectAs`, that allows you to specify a CSS selector on
any element. Whenever an element with `ngProjectAs` is checked against an `<ng-content>`
placeholder, Angular compares against the `ngProjectAs` value instead of the element's identity:

```angular-html
<!-- Component template -->
<div class="card-shadow">
  <ng-content select="card-title"></ng-content>
  <div class="card-divider"></div>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<custom-card>
  <h3 ngProjectAs="card-title">Hello</h3>

  <p>Welcome to the example</p>
</custom-card>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<custom-card>
  <div class="card-shadow">
    <h3>Hello</h3>
    <div class="card-divider"></div>
    <p>Welcome to the example</p>
  </div>
</custom-card>
```

`ngProjectAs` supports only static values and cannot be bound to dynamic expressions.

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/dom-apis.md
================================================
# Using DOM APIs

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Angular handles most DOM creation, updates, and removals for you. However, you might rarely need to
directly interact with a component's DOM. Components can inject ElementRef to get a reference to the
component's host element:

```ts
@Component({...})
export class ProfilePhoto {
  constructor() {
    const elementRef = inject(ElementRef);
    console.log(elementRef.nativeElement);
  }
}
```

The `nativeElement` property references the
host [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element) instance.

You can use Angular's `afterRender` and `afterNextRender` functions to register a **render
callback** that runs when Angular has finished rendering the page.

```ts
@Component({...})
export class ProfilePhoto {
  constructor() {
    const elementRef = inject(ElementRef);
    afterRender(() => {
      // Focus the first input element in this component.
      elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('input')?.focus();
    });
  }
}
```

`afterRender` and `afterNextRender` must be called in an _injection context_, typically a
component's constructor.

**Avoid direct DOM manipulation whenever possible.** Always prefer expressing your DOM's structure
in component templates and updating that DOM with bindings.

**Render callbacks never run during server-side rendering or build-time pre-rendering.**

**Never directly manipulate the DOM inside of other Angular lifecycle hooks**. Angular does not
guarantee that a component's DOM is fully rendered at any point other than in render callbacks.
Further, reading or modifying the DOM during other lifecycle hooks can negatively impact page
performance by
causing [layout thrashing](https://web.dev/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing).

## Using a component's renderer

Components can inject an instance of `Renderer2` to perform certain DOM manipulations that are tied
to other Angular features.

Any DOM elements created by a component's `Renderer2` participate in that
component's [style encapsulation](guide/components/styling#style-scoping).

Certain `Renderer2` APIs also tie into Angular's animation system. You can use the `setProperty`
method to update synthetic animation properties and the `listen` method to add event listeners for
synthetic animation events. See the [Animations](guide/animations) guide for details.

Aside from these two narrow use-cases, there is no difference between using `Renderer2` and native
DOM APIs. `Renderer2` APIs do not support DOM manipulation in server-side rendering or build-time
pre-rendering contexts.

## When to use DOM APIs

While Angular handles most rendering concerns, some behaviors may still require using DOM APIs. Some
common use cases include:

- Managing element focus
- Measuring element geometry, such as with `getBoundingClientRect`
- Reading an element's text content
- Setting up native observers such
  as [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver),
  [`ResizeObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver), or
  [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

Avoid inserting, removing, and modifying DOM elements. In particular, **never directly set an
element's `innerHTML` property**, which can make your application vulnerable
to [cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting).
Angular's template bindings, including bindings for `innerHTML`, include safeguards that help
protect against XSS attacks. See the [Security guide](best-practices/security) for details.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/host-elements.md
================================================
# Component host elements

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Angular creates an instance of a component for every HTML element that matches the component's
selector. The DOM element that matches a component's selector is that component's **host element**.
The contents of a component's template are rendered inside its host element.

```angular-ts
// Component source
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `
    <img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo" />
  `,
})
export class ProfilePhoto {}
```

```angular-html
<!-- Using the component -->
<h3>Your profile photo</h3>
<profile-photo />
<button>Upload a new profile photo</button>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<h3>Your profile photo</h3>
<profile-photo>
  <img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo" />
</profile-photo>
<button>Upload a new profile photo</button>
```

In the above example, `<profile-photo>` is the host element of the `ProfilePhoto` component.

## Binding to the host element

A component can bind properties, attributes, and events to its host element. This behaves
identically to bindings on elements inside the component's template, but instead defined with
the `host` property in the `@Component` decorator:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  ...,
  host: {
    'role': 'slider',
    '[attr.aria-valuenow]': 'value',
    '[class.active]': 'isActive()',
    '[tabIndex]': 'disabled ? -1 : 0',
    '(keydown)': 'updateValue($event)',
  },
})
export class CustomSlider {
  value: number = 0;
  disabled: boolean = false;
  isActive = signal(false);
  updateValue(event: KeyboardEvent) { /* ... */ }

  /* ... */
}
```

## The `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators

You can alternatively bind to the host element by applying the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener`
decorator to class members.

`@HostBinding` lets you bind host properties and attributes to properties and methods:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class CustomSlider {
  @HostBinding('attr.aria-valuenow')
  value: number = 0;

  @HostBinding('tabIndex')
  getTabIndex() {
    return this.disabled ? -1 : 0;
  }

  /* ... */
}
```

`@HostListener` lets you bind event listeners to the host element. The decorator accepts an event
name and an optional array of arguments:

```ts
export class CustomSlider {
  @HostListener('keydown', ['$event'])
  updateValue(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

**Always prefer using the `host` property over `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener`.** These
decorators exist exclusively for backwards compatibility.

## Binding collisions

When you use a component in a template, you can add bindings to that component instance's element.
The component may _also_ define host bindings for the same properties or attributes.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  ...,
  host: {
    'role': 'presentation',
    '[id]': 'id',
  }
})
export class ProfilePhoto { /* ... */ }
```

```angular-html
<profile-photo role="group" [id]="otherId" />
```

In cases like this, the following rules determine which value wins:

- If both values are static, the instance binding wins.
- If one value is static and the other dynamic, the dynamic value wins.
- If both values are dynamic, the component's host binding wins.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/inheritance.md
================================================
# Inheritance

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Angular components are TypeScript classes and participate in standard JavaScript inheritance
semantics.

A component can extend any base class:

```ts
export class ListboxBase {
  value: string;
}

@Component({ ... })
export class CustomListbox extends ListboxBase {
  // CustomListbox inherits the `value` property.
}
```

## Extending other components and directives

When a component extends another component or a directive, it inherits some of the metadata defined in
the base class's decorator and the base class's decorated members. This includes
host bindings, inputs, outputs, lifecycle methods.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'base-listbox',
  template: `
    ...
  `,
  host: {
    '(keydown)': 'handleKey($event)',
  },
})
export class ListboxBase {
  @Input() value: string;
  handleKey(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    /* ... */
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-listbox',
  template: `
    ...
  `,
  host: {
    '(click)': 'focusActiveOption()',
  },
})
export class CustomListbox extends ListboxBase {
  @Input() disabled = false;
  focusActiveOption() {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

In the example above, `CustomListbox` inherits all the information associated with `ListboxBase`,
overriding the selector and template with its own values. `CustomListbox` has two inputs (`value`
and `disabled`) and two event listeners (`keydown` and `click`).

Child classes end up with the _union_ of all of their ancestors' inputs, outputs, and host bindings
and their own.

### Forwarding injected dependencies

If a base class injects dependencies as constructor parameters, the child class must explicitly class these dependencies to `super`.

```ts
@Component({ ... })
export class ListboxBase {
  constructor(private element: ElementRef) { }
}

@Component({ ... })
export class CustomListbox extends ListboxBase {
  constructor(element: ElementRef) {
    super(element);
  }
}
```

### Overriding lifecycle methods

If a base class defines a lifecycle method, such as `ngOnInit`, a child class that also
implements `ngOnInit` _overrides_ the base class's implementation. If you want to preserve the base
class's lifecycle method, explicitly call the method with `super`:

```ts
@Component({ ... })
export class ListboxBase {
  protected isInitialized = false;
  ngOnInit() {
    this.isInitialized = true;
  }
}

@Component({ ... })
export class CustomListbox extends ListboxBase {
  override ngOnInit() {
    super.ngOnInit();
    /* ... */
  }
}
```



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/inputs.md
================================================
# Accepting data with input properties

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

TIP: If you're familiar with other web frameworks, input properties are similar to _props_.

When you use a component, you commonly want to pass some data to it. A component specifies the data that it accepts by declaring
**inputs**:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[7]">
import {Component, input} from '@angular/core';

@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  // Declare an input named 'value' with a default value of zero.
  value = input(0);
}
</docs-code>

This lets you bind to the property in a template:

```angular-html
<custom-slider [value]="50" />
```

If an input has a default value, TypeScript infers the type from the default value:

```typescript
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  // TypeScript infers that this input is a number, returning InputSignal<number>.
  value = input(0);
}
```

You can explicitly declare a type for the input by specifying a generic parameter to the function.

If an input without a default value is not set, its value is `undefined`:

```typescript
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  // Produces an InputSignal<number | undefined> because `value` may not be set.
  value = input<number>();
}
```

**Angular records inputs statically at compile-time**. Inputs cannot be added or removed at run-time.

The `input` function has special meaning to the Angular compiler. **You can exclusively call `input` in component and directive property initializers.**

When extending a component class, **inputs are inherited by the child class.**

**Input names are case-sensitive.**

## Reading inputs

The `input` function returns an `InputSignal`. You can read the value by calling the signal:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[5]">
import {Component, input} from '@angular/core';

@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  // Declare an input named 'value' with a default value of zero. 
  value = input(0);

  // Create a computed expression that reads the value input
  label = computed(() => `The slider's value is ${this.value()}`); 
}
</docs-code>

Signals created by the `input` function are read-only.

## Required inputs

You can declare that an input is `required` by calling `input.required` instead of `input`:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  // Declare a required input named value. Returns an `InputSignal<number>`.
  value = input.required<number>();
}
</docs-code>

Angular enforces that required inputs _must_ be set when the component is used in a template. If you try to use a component without specifying all of its required inputs, Angular reports an error at build-time.

Required inputs do not automatically include `undefined` in the generic parameter of the returned `InputSignal`.

## Configuring inputs

The `input` function accepts a config object as a second parameter that lets you change the way that input works.

### Input transforms

You can specify a `transform` function to change the value of an input when it's set by Angular.

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[6]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-slider',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomSlider {
  label = input('', {transform: trimString});
}

function trimString(value: string | undefined): string {
  return value?.trim() ?? '';
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<custom-slider [label]="systemVolume" />
```

In the example above, whenever the value of `systemVolume` changes, Angular runs `trimString` and sets `label` to the result.

The most common use-case for input transforms is to accept a wider range of value types in templates, often including `null` and `undefined`.

**Input transform function must be statically analyzable at build-time.** You cannot set transform functions conditionally or as the result of an expression evaluation.

**Input transform functions should always be [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).** Relying on state outside the transform function can lead to unpredictable behavior.

#### Type checking

When you specify an input transform, the type of the transform function's parameter determines the types of values that can be set to the input in a template.

<docs-code language="ts">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  widthPx = input('', {transform: appendPx});
}

function appendPx(value: number): string {
  return `${value}px`;
}
</docs-code>

In the example above, the `widthPx` input accepts a `number` while the `InputSignal` property returns a `string`.

#### Built-in transformations

Angular includes two built-in transform functions for the two most common scenarios: coercing values to boolean and numbers.

<docs-code language="ts">
import {Component, input, booleanAttribute, numberAttribute} from '@angular/core';

@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  disabled = input(false, {transform: booleanAttribute}); 
  value = input(0, {transform: numberAttribute}); 
}
</docs-code>

`booleanAttribute` imitates the behavior of standard HTML [boolean attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML), where the
_presence_ of the attribute indicates a "true" value. However, Angular's `booleanAttribute` treats the literal string `"false"` as the boolean `false`.

`numberAttribute` attempts to parse the given value to a number, producing `NaN` if parsing fails.

### Input aliases

You can specify the `alias` option to change the name of an input in templates.

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  value = input(0, {alias: 'sliderValue'});
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<custom-slider [sliderValue]="50" />
```

This alias does not affect usage of the property in TypeScript code.

While you should generally avoid aliasing inputs for components, this feature can be useful for renaming properties while preserving an alias for the original name or for avoiding collisions with the name of native DOM element properties.

## Model inputs

**Model inputs** are a special type of input that enable a component to propagate new values back to its parent component.

When creating a component, you can define a model input similarly to how you create a standard input.

Both types of input allow someone to bind a value into the property. However, **model inputs allow the component author to write values into the property**. If the property is bound with a two-way binding, the new value propagates to that binding.

```typescript
@Component({ /* ... */})
export class CustomSlider {
  // Define a model input named "value".
  value = model(0);

  increment() {
    // Update the model input with a new value, propagating the value to any bindings. 
    this.value.update(oldValue => oldValue + 10);
  }
}

@Component({
  /* ... */
  // Using the two-way binding syntax means that any changes to the slider's
  // value automatically propagate back to the `volume` signal.
  // Note that this binding uses the signal *instance*, not the signal value.
  template: `<custom-slider [(value)]="volume" />`,
})
export class MediaControls {
  // Create a writable signal for the `volume` local state. 
  volume = signal(0);
}
```

In the above example, the `CustomSlider` can write values into its `value` model input, which then propagates those values back to the `volume` signal in `MediaControls`. This binding keeps the values of `value` and `volume` in sync. Notice that the binding passes the `volume` signal instance, not the _value_ of the signal.

In other respects, model inputs work similarly to standard inputs. You can read the value by calling the signal function, including in reactive contexts like `computed` and `effect`.

See [Two-way binding](guide/templates/two-way-binding) for more details on two-way binding in templates.

### Two-way binding with plain properties

You can bind a plain JavaScript property to a model input.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
  // `value` is a model input.
  // The parenthesis-inside-square-brackets syntax (aka "banana-in-a-box") creates a two-way binding
  template: '<custom-slider [(value)]="volume" />',
})
export class MediaControls {
  protected volume = 0;
}
```

In the example above, the `CustomSlider` can write values into its `value` model input, which then propagates those values back to the `volume` property in `MediaControls`. This binding keeps the values of `value` and `volume` in sync.

### Implicit `change` events

When you declare a model input in a component or directive, Angular automatically creates a corresponding [output](guide/components/outputs) for that model. The output's name is the model input's name suffixed with "Change".

```angular-ts
@Directive({ /* ... */ })
export class CustomCheckbox {
  // This automatically creates an output named "checkedChange".
  // Can be subscribed to using `(checkedChange)="handler()"` in the template.
  checked = model(false);
}
```

Angular emits this change event whenever you write a new value into the model input by calling its `set` or `update` methods.

See [Custom events with outputs](guide/components/outputs) for more details on outputs.

### Customizing model inputs

You can mark a model input as required or provide an alias in the same way as a [standard input](guide/signals/inputs).

Model inputs do not support input transforms.

### When to use model inputs

Use model inputs when you want a component to support two-way binding. This is typically appropriate when a component exists to modify a value based on user interaction. Most commonly, custom form controls, such as a date picker or combobox, should use model inputs for their primary value.

## Choosing input names

Avoid choosing input names that collide with properties on DOM elements like HTMLElement. Name collisions introduce confusion about whether the bound property belongs to the component or the DOM element.

Avoid adding prefixes for component inputs like you would with component selectors. Since a given element can only host one component, any custom properties can be assumed to belong to the component.

## Declaring inputs with the `@Input` decorator

TIP: While the Angular team recommends using the signal-based `input` function for new projects, the original decorator-based `@Input` API remains fully supported.

You can alternatively declare component inputs by adding the `@Input` decorator to a property:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({...})
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input() value = 0;
}
</docs-code>

Binding to an input is the same in both signal-based and decorator-based inputs:

```angular-html
<custom-slider [value]="50" />
```

### Customizing decorator-based inputs

The `@Input` decorator accepts a config object that lets you change the way that input works.

#### Required inputs

You can specify the `required` option to enforce that a given input must always have a value.

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({...})
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input({required: true}) value = 0;
}
</docs-code>

If you try to use a component without specifying all of its required inputs, Angular reports an error at build-time.

#### Input transforms

You can specify a `transform` function to change the value of an input when it's set by Angular. This transform function works identically to transform functions for signal-based inputs described above.

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[6]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-slider',
  ...
})
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input({transform: trimString}) label = '';
}

function trimString(value: string | undefined) { return value?.trim() ?? ''; }
</docs-code>

#### Input aliases

You can specify the `alias` option to change the name of an input in templates.

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({...})
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input({alias: 'sliderValue'}) value = 0;
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<custom-slider [sliderValue]="50" />
```

The `@Input` decorator also accepts the alias as its first parameter in place of the config object.

Input aliases work the same way as for signal-based inputs described above.

### Inputs with getters and setters

When using decorator-based inputs, a property implemented with a getter and setter can be an input:

<docs-code language="ts">
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input()
  get value(): number {
    return this.internalValue;
  }

set value(newValue: number) { this.internalValue = newValue; }

private internalValue = 0; }
</docs-code>

You can even create a _write-only_ input by only defining a public setter:

<docs-code language="ts">
export class CustomSlider {
  @Input()
  set value(newValue: number) {
    this.internalValue = newValue;
  }

private internalValue = 0; }
</docs-code>

**Prefer using input transforms instead of getters and setters** if possible.

Avoid complex or costly getters and setters. Angular may invoke an input's setter multiple times, which may negatively impact application performance if the setter performs any costly behaviors, such as DOM manipulation.

## Specify inputs in the `@Component` decorator

In addition to the `@Input` decorator, you can also specify a component's inputs with the `inputs` property in the `@Component` decorator. This can be useful when a component inherits a property from a base class:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[4]">
// `CustomSlider` inherits the `disabled` property from `BaseSlider`.
@Component({
  ...,
  inputs: ['disabled'],
})
export class CustomSlider extends BaseSlider { }
</docs-code>

You can additionally specify an input alias in the `inputs` list by putting the alias after a colon in the string:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="[4]">
// `CustomSlider` inherits the `disabled` property from `BaseSlider`.
@Component({
  ...,
  inputs: ['disabled: sliderDisabled'],
})
export class CustomSlider extends BaseSlider { }
</docs-code>

================================================
# Component Lifecycle

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

A component's **lifecycle** is the sequence of steps that happen between the component's creation
and its destruction. Each step represents a different part of Angular's process for rendering
components and checking them for updates over time.

In your components, you can implement **lifecycle hooks** to run code during these steps.
Lifecycle hooks that relate to a specific component instance are implemented as methods on your
component class. Lifecycle hooks that relate the Angular application as a whole are implemented
as functions that accept a callback.

A component's lifecycle is tightly connected to how Angular checks your components for changes over
time. For the purposes of understanding this lifecycle, you only need to know that Angular walks
your application tree from top to bottom, checking template bindings for changes. The lifecycle
hooks described below run while Angular is doing this traversal. This traversal visits each
component exactly once, so you should always avoid making further state changes in the middle of the
process.

      <td><code>ngOnDestroy</code></td>
      <td>Runs once before the component is destroyed.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### ngOnInit

The `ngOnInit` method runs after Angular has initialized all the components inputs with their
initial values. A component's `ngOnInit` runs exactly once.

This step happens _before_ the component's own template is initialized. This means that you can
update the component's state based on its initial input values.

### ngOnChanges

The `ngOnChanges` method runs after any component inputs have changed.

This step happens _before_ the component's own template is checked. This means that you can update
the component's state based on its initial input values.

During initialization, the first `ngOnChanges` runs before `ngOnInit`.

#### Inspecting changes

The `ngOnChanges` method accepts one `SimpleChanges` argument. This object is
a [`Record`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type)
mapping each component input name to a `SimpleChange` object. Each `SimpleChange` contains the
input's previous value, its current value, and a flag for whether this is the first time the input
has changed.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class UserProfile {
  @Input() name: string = '';

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    for (const inputName in changes) {
      const inputValues = changes[inputName];
      console.log(`Previous ${inputName} == ${inputValues.previousValue}`);
      console.log(`Current ${inputName} == ${inputValues.currentValue}`);
      console.log(`Is first ${inputName} change == ${inputValues.firstChange}`);
    }
  }
}
```

If you provide an `alias` for any input properties, the `SimpleChanges` Record still uses the
TypeScript property name as a key, rather than the alias.

### ngOnDestroy

The `ngOnDestroy` method runs once just before a component is destroyed. Angular destroys a
component when it is no longer shown on the page, such as being hidden by `@if` or upon navigating
to another page.

#### DestroyRef

As an alternative to the `ngOnDestroy` method, you can inject an instance of `DestroyRef`. You can
register a callback to be invoked upon the component's destruction by calling the `onDestroy` method
of `DestroyRef`.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class UserProfile {
  constructor() {
    inject(DestroyRef).onDestroy(() => {
      console.log('UserProfile destruction');
    });
  }
}
```

You can pass the `DestroyRef` instance to functions or classes outside your component. Use this
pattern if you have other code that should run some cleanup behavior when the component is
destroyed.

You can also use `DestroyRef` to keep setup code close to cleanup code, rather than putting
all cleanup code in the `ngOnDestroy` method.

### ngDoCheck

The `ngDoCheck` method runs before every time Angular checks a component's template for changes.

You can use this lifecycle hook to manually check for state changes outside of Angular's normal
change detection, manually updating the component's state.

This method runs very frequently and can significantly impact your page's performance. Avoid
defining this hook whenever possible, only using it when you have no alternative.

During initialization, the first `ngDoCheck` runs after `ngOnInit`.

### ngAfterContentInit

The `ngAfterContentInit` method runs once after all the children nested inside the component (its
_content_) have been initialized.

You can use this lifecycle hook to read the results of
[content queries](guide/components/queries#content-queries). While you can access the initialized
state of these queries, attempting to change any state in this method results in an
[ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError](errors/NG0100)

### ngAfterContentChecked

The `ngAfterContentChecked` method runs every time the children nested inside the component (its
_content_) have been checked for changes.

This method runs very frequently and can significantly impact your page's performance. Avoid
defining this hook whenever possible, only using it when you have no alternative.

While you can access the updated state
of [content queries](guide/components/queries#content-queries) here, attempting to
change any state in this method results in
an [ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError](errors/NG0100).

### ngAfterViewInit

The `ngAfterViewInit` method runs once after all the children in the component's template (its
_view_) have been initialized.

You can use this lifecycle hook to read the results of
[view queries](guide/components/queries#view-queries). While you can access the initialized state of
these queries, attempting to change any state in this method results in an
[ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError](errors/NG0100)

### ngAfterViewChecked

The `ngAfterViewChecked` method runs every time the children in the component's template (its
_view_) have been checked for changes.

This method runs very frequently and can significantly impact your page's performance. Avoid
defining this hook whenever possible, only using it when you have no alternative.

While you can access the updated state of [view queries](guide/components/queries#view-queries)
here, attempting to
change any state in this method results in
an [ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError](errors/NG0100).

### afterRender and afterNextRender

The `afterRender` and `afterNextRender` functions let you register a **render callback** to be
invoked after Angular has finished rendering _all components_ on the page into the DOM.

These functions are different from the other lifecycle hooks described in this guide. Rather than a
class method, they are standalone functions that accept a callback. The execution of render
callbacks are not tied to any specific component instance, but instead an application-wide hook.

`afterRender` and `afterNextRender` must be called in
an [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context), typically a
component's constructor.

You can use render callbacks to perform manual DOM operations.
See [Using DOM APIs](guide/components/dom-apis) for guidance on working with the DOM in Angular.

Render callbacks do not run during server-side rendering or during build-time pre-rendering.

#### afterRender phases

When using `afterRender` or `afterNextRender`, you can optionally split the work into phases. The
phase gives you control over the sequencing of DOM operations, letting you sequence _write_
operations before _read_ operations in order to minimize
[layout thrashing](https://web.dev/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing). In order to
communicate across phases, a phase function may return a result value that can be accessed in the
next phase.

```ts
import {Component, ElementRef, afterNextRender} from '@angular/core';

@Component({...})
export class UserProfile {
  private prevPadding = 0;
  private elementHeight = 0;

  constructor() {
    private elementRef = inject(ElementRef);
    const nativeElement = elementRef.nativeElement;

    afterNextRender({
      // Use the `Write` phase to write to a geometric property.
      write: () => {
        const padding = computePadding();
        const changed = padding !== this.prevPadding;
        if (changed) {
          nativeElement.style.padding = padding;
        }
        return changed; // Communicate whether anything changed to the read phase.
      },

      // Use the `Read` phase to read geometric properties after all writes have occurred.
      read: (didWrite) => {
        if (didWrite) {
          this.elementHeight = nativeElement.getBoundingClientRect().height;
        }
      }
    });
  }
}
```

There are four phases, run in the following order:

| Phase            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `earlyRead`      | Use this phase to read any layout-affecting DOM properties and styles that are strictly necessary for subsequent calculation. Avoid this phase if possible, preferring the `write` and `read` phases. |
| `mixedReadWrite` | Default phase. Use for any operations need to both read and write layout-affecting properties and styles. Avoid this phase if possible, preferring the explicit `write` and `read` phases.            |
| `write`          | Use this phase to write layout-affecting DOM properties and styles.                                                                                                                                   |
| `read`           | Use this phase to read any layout-affecting DOM properties.                                                                                                                                           |

## Lifecycle interfaces

Angular provides a TypeScript interface for each lifecycle method. You can optionally import
and `implement` these interfaces to ensure that your implementation does not have any typos or
misspellings.

Each interface has the same name as the corresponding method without the `ng` prefix. For example,
the interface for `ngOnInit` is `OnInit`.

```ts
@Component({
  /* ... */
})
export class UserProfile implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit() {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

## Execution order

The following diagrams show the execution order of Angular's lifecycle hooks.

### During initialization

```mermaid
graph TD;
id[constructor]-->CHANGE;
subgraph CHANGE [Change detection]
direction TB
ngOnChanges-->ngOnInit;
ngOnInit-->ngDoCheck;
ngDoCheck-->ngAfterContentInit;
ngDoCheck-->ngAfterViewInit
ngAfterContentInit-->ngAfterContentChecked
ngAfterViewInit-->ngAfterViewChecked
end
CHANGE--Rendering-->afterRender
```

### Subsequent updates

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph CHANGE [Change detection]
direction TB
ngOnChanges-->ngDoCheck
ngDoCheck-->ngAfterContentChecked;
ngDoCheck-->ngAfterViewChecked
end
CHANGE--Rendering-->afterRender
```

### Ordering with directives

When you put one or more directives on the same element as a component, either in a template or with
the `hostDirectives` property, the framework does not guarantee any ordering of a given lifecycle
hook between the component and the directives on a single element. Never depend on an observed
ordering, as this may change in later versions of Angular.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/outputs.md
================================================
# Custom events with outputs

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Angular components can define custom events by assigning a property to the `output` function:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="3">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class ExpandablePanel {
  panelClosed = output<void>();
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<expandable-panel (panelClosed)="savePanelState()" />
```

The `output` function returns an `OutputEmitterRef`. You can emit an event by calling the `emit` method on the `OutputEmitterRef`:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
  this.panelClosed.emit();
</docs-code>

Angular refers to properties initialized with the `output` function as **outputs**. You can use outputs to raise custom events, similar to native browser events like `click`.

**Angular custom events do not bubble up the DOM**.

**Output names are case-sensitive.**

When extending a component class, **outputs are inherited by the child class.**

The `output` function has special meaning to the Angular compiler. **You can exclusively call `output` in component and directive property initializers.**

## Emitting event data

You can pass event data when calling `emit`:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
// You can emit primitive values.
this.valueChanged.emit(7);

// You can emit custom event objects
this.thumbDropped.emit({
  pointerX: 123,
  pointerY: 456,
})
</docs-code>

When defining an event listener in a template, you can access the event data from the `$event` variable:

```angular-html
<custom-slider (valueChanged)="logValue($event)" />
```

## Customizing output names

The `output` function accepts a parameter that lets you specify a different name for the event in a template:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  changed = output({alias: 'valueChanged'});
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<custom-slider (valueChanged)="saveVolume()" />
```

This alias does not affect usage of the property in TypeScript code.

While you should generally avoid aliasing outputs for components, this feature can be useful for renaming properties while preserving an alias for the original name or for avoiding collisions with the name of native DOM events.

## Subscribing to outputs programmatically

When creating a component dynamically, you can programmatically subscribe to output events
from the component instance. The `OutputRef` type includes a `subscribe` method:

```ts
const someComponentRef: ComponentRef<SomeComponent> = viewContainerRef.createComponent(/*...*/);

someComponentRef.instance.someEventProperty.subscribe(eventData => {
  console.log(eventData);
});
```

Angular automatically cleans up event subscriptions when it destroys components with subscribers. Alternatively, you can manually unsubscribe from an event. The `subscribe` function returns an `OutputRefSubscription` with an `unsubscribe` method:

```typescript
const eventSubscription = someComponent.someEventProperty.subscribe(eventData => {
  console.log(eventData);
});

// ...

eventSubscription.unsubscribe();
```

## Choosing event names

Avoid choosing output names that collide with events on DOM elements like HTMLElement. Name collisions introduce confusion about whether the bound property belongs to the component or the DOM element.

Avoid adding prefixes for component outputs like you would with component selectors. Since a given element can only host one component, any custom properties can be assumed to belong to the component.

Always use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) output names. Avoid prefixing output names with "on".

## Using outputs with RxJS

See [RxJS interop with component and directive outputs](ecosystem/rxjs-interop/output-interop) for details on interoperability between outputs and RxJS.

## Declaring outputs with the `@Output` decorator

TIP: While the Angular team recommends using the `output` function for new projects, the
original decorator-based `@Output` API remains fully supported.

You can alternatively define custom events by assigning a property to a new `EventEmitter` and adding the `@Output` decorator:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class ExpandablePanel {
  @Output() panelClosed = new EventEmitter<void>();
}
</docs-code>

You can emit an event by calling the `emit` method on the `EventEmitter`.

### Aliases with the `@Output` decorator

The `@Output` decorator accepts a parameter that lets you specify a different name for the event in a template:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomSlider {
  @Output('valueChanged') changed = new EventEmitter<number>();
}
</docs-code>

```angular-html
<custom-slider (valueChanged)="saveVolume()" />
```

This alias does not affect usage of the property in TypeScript code.

## Specify outputs in the `@Component` decorator

In addition to the `@Output` decorator, you can also specify a component's outputs with the `outputs` property in the `@Component` decorator. This can be useful when a component inherits a property from a base class:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
// `CustomSlider` inherits the `valueChanged` property from `BaseSlider`.
@Component({
  /*...*/
  outputs: ['valueChanged'],
})
export class CustomSlider extends BaseSlider {}
</docs-code>

You can additionally specify an output alias in the `outputs` list by putting the alias after a colon in the string:

<docs-code language="ts" highlight="">
// `CustomSlider` inherits the `valueChanged` property from `BaseSlider`.
@Component({
  /*...*/
  outputs: ['valueChanged: volumeChanged'],
})
export class CustomSlider extends BaseSlider {}
</docs-code>

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/programmatic-rendering.md
================================================
# Programmatically rendering components

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

In addition to using a component directly in a template, you can also dynamically render components.
There are two main ways to dynamically render a component: in a template with `NgComponentOutlet`,
or in your TypeScript code with `ViewContainerRef`.

## Using NgComponentOutlet

`NgComponentOutlet` is a structural directive that dynamically renders a given component in a
template.

```angular-ts
@Component({ ... })
export class AdminBio { /* ... */ }

@Component({ ... })
export class StandardBio { /* ... */ }

@Component({
  ...,
  template: `
    <p>Profile for {{user.name}}</p>
    <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="getBioComponent()" /> `
})
export class CustomDialog {
  @Input() user: User;

  getBioComponent() {
    return this.user.isAdmin ? AdminBio : StandardBio;
  }
}
```

See the [NgComponentOutlet API reference](api/common/NgComponentOutlet) for more information on the
directive's capabilities.

## Using ViewContainerRef

A **view container** is a node in Angular's component tree that can contain content. Any component
or directive can inject `ViewContainerRef` to get a reference to a view container corresponding to
that component or directive's location in the DOM.

You can use the `createComponent`method on `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically create and render a
component. When you create a new component with a `ViewContainerRef`, Angular appends it into the
DOM as the next sibling of the component or directive that injected the `ViewContainerRef`.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'leaf-content',
  template: `
    This is the leaf content
  `,
})
export class LeafContent {}

@Component({
  selector: 'outer-container',
  template: `
    <p>This is the start of the outer container</p>
    <inner-item />
    <p>This is the end of the outer container</p>
  `,
})
export class OuterContainer {}

@Component({
  selector: 'inner-item',
  template: `
    <button (click)="loadContent()">Load content</button>
  `,
})
export class InnerItem {
  private viewContainer = inject(ViewContainerRef);

  loadContent() {
    this.viewContainer.createComponent(LeafContent);
  }
}
```

In the example above, clicking the "Load content" button results in the following DOM structure

```angular-html
<outer-container>
  <p>This is the start of the outer container</p>
  <inner-item>
    <button>Load content</button>
  </inner-item>
  <leaf-content>This is the leaf content</leaf-content>
  <p>This is the end of the outer container</p>
</outer-container>
```

## Lazy-loading components

You can use both of the approaches described above, `NgComponentOutlet` and `ViewContainerRef`, to
render components that are lazy-loaded with a standard
JavaScript [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import).

```angular-ts
@Component({
  ...,
  template: `
    <section>
      <h2>Basic settings</h2>
      <basic-settings />
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Advanced settings</h2>
      <button (click)="loadAdvanced()" *ngIf="!advancedSettings">
        Load advanced settings
      </button>
      <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="advancedSettings" />
    </section>
  `
})
export class AdminSettings {
  advancedSettings: {new(): AdvancedSettings} | undefined;

  async loadAdvanced() {
    const { AdvancedSettings } = await import('path/to/advanced_settings.js');
    this.advancedSettings = AdvancedSettings;
  }
}
```

The example above loads and displays the `AdvancedSettings` upon receiving a button click.

================================================
# Referencing component children with queries

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

A component can define **queries** that find child elements and read values from their injectors.

Developers most commonly use queries to retrieve references to child components, directives, DOM elements, and more.

All query functions return signals that reflect the most up-to-date results. You can read the
result by calling the signal function, including in reactive contexts like `computed` and `effect`.

There are two categories of query: **view queries** and **content queries.**

## View queries

View queries retrieve results from the elements in the component's _view_ — the elements defined in the component's own template. You can query for a single result with the `viewChild` function.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 15]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card-header',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomCardHeader {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: '<custom-card-header>Visit sunny California!</custom-card-header>',
})
export class CustomCard {
  header = viewChild(CustomCardHeader);
  headerText = computed(() => this.header()?.text);
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the `CustomCard` component queries for a child `CustomCardHeader` and uses the result in a `computed`.

If the query does not find a result, its value is `undefined`. This may occur if the target element is hidden by `@if`. Angular keeps the result of `viewChild` up to date as your application state changes.

You can also query for multiple results with the `viewChildren` function.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card-action',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomCardAction {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: `
    <custom-card-action>Save</custom-card-action>
    <custom-card-action>Cancel</custom-card-action>
  `,
})
export class CustomCard {
  actions = viewChildren(CustomCardAction);
  actionsTexts = computed(() => this.actions().map(action => action.text);
}
</docs-code>

`viewChildren` creates a signal with an `Array` of the query results.

**Queries never pierce through component boundaries.** View queries can only retrieve results from the component's template.

## Content queries

Content queries retrieve results from the elements in the component's _content_— the elements nested inside the component in the template where it's used. You can query for a single result with the `contentChild` function.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 15]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-toggle',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomToggle {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-expando',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomExpando {
  toggle = contentChild(CustomToggle);
  toggleText = computed(() => this.toggle()?.text);
}

@Component({ 
  /* ... */
  // CustomToggle is used inside CustomExpando as content.  
  template: `
    <custom-expando>
      <custom-toggle>Show</custom-toggle>
    </custom-expando>
  `
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

In this example, the `CustomExpando` component queries for a child `CustomToggle` and accesses the result in a `computed`.

If the query does not find a result, its value is `undefined`. This may occur if the target element is absent or hidden by `@if`. Angular keeps the result of `contentChild` up to date as your application state changes.

By default, content queries find only _direct_ children of the component and do not traverse into descendants.

You can also query for multiple results with the `contentChildren` function.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-menu-item',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomMenuItem {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-menu',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomMenu {
  items = contentChildren(CustomMenuItem);
  itemTexts = computed(() => this.items().map(item => item.text));
}

@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <custom-menu>
      <custom-menu-item>Cheese</custom-menu-item>
      <custom-menu-item>Tomato</custom-menu-item>
    </custom-menu>
  `
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

`contentChildren` creates a signal with an `Array` of the query results.

**Queries never pierce through component boundaries.** Content queries can only retrieve results from the same template as the component itself.

## Required queries

If a child query (`viewChild` or `contentChild`) does not find a result, its value is `undefined`. This may occur if the target element is hidden by a control flow statement like `@if` or `@for`. Because of this, the child queries return a signal that include `undefined` in their value type.

In some cases, especially with `viewChild`, you know with certainty that a specific child is always available. In other cases, you may want to strictly enforce that a specific child is present. For these cases, you can use a *required query*.

```angular-ts
@Component({/* ... */})
export class CustomCard {
  header = viewChild.required(CustomCardHeader);
  body = contentChild.required(CustomCardBody);
}
```

If a required query does not find a matching result, Angular reports an error. Because this guarantees that a result is available, required queries do not automatically include `undefined` in the signal's value type.

## Query locators

This first parameter for each query decorator is its **locator**.

Most of the time, you want to use a component or directive as your locator.

You can alternatively specify a string locator corresponding to
a [template reference variable](guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables).

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /*...*/
  template: `
    <button #save>Save</button>
    <button #cancel>Cancel</button>
  `
})
export class ActionBar {
  saveButton = viewChild<ElementRef<HTMLButtonElement>>('save');
}
```

If more than one element defines the same template reference variable, the query retrieves the first matching element.

Angular does not support CSS selectors as query locators.

### Queries and the injector tree

TIP: See [Dependency Injection](guide/di) for background on providers and Angular's injection tree.

For more advanced cases, you can use any `ProviderToken` as a locator. This lets you locate elements based on component and directive providers.

```angular-ts
const SUB_ITEM = new InjectionToken<string>('sub-item');

@Component({
  /*...*/
  providers: [{provide: SUB_ITEM, useValue: 'special-item'}],
})
export class SpecialItem { }

@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomList {
  subItemType = contentChild(SUB_ITEM);
}
```

The above example uses an `InjectionToken` as a locator, but you can use any `ProviderToken` to locate specific elements.

## Query options

All query functions accept an options object as a second parameter. These options control how the query finds its results.

### Reading specific values from an element's injector

By default, the query locator indicates both the element you're searching for and the value retrieved. You can alternatively specify the `read` option to retrieve a different value from the element matched by the locator.

```ts
@Component({/*...*/})
export class CustomExpando {
  toggle = contentChild(ExpandoContent, {read: TemplateRef});
}
```

The above example, locates an element with the directive `ExpandoContent` and retrieves
the `TemplateRef` associated with that element.

Developers most commonly use `read` to retrieve `ElementRef` and `TemplateRef`.

### Content descendants

By default, content queries find only _direct_ children of the component and do not traverse into descendants.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[13, 14, 15, 16]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-expando',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomExpando {
  toggle = contentChild(CustomToggle);
}

@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <custom-expando>
      <some-other-component>
        <!-- custom-toggle will not be found! -->
        <custom-toggle>Show</custom-toggle>
      </some-other-component>
    </custom-expando>
  `
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

In the example above, `CustomExpando` cannot find `<custom-toggle>` because it is not a direct child of `<custom-expando>`. By setting `descendants: true`, you configure the query to traverse all descendants in the same template. Queries, however, _never_ pierce into components to traverse elements in other templates.

View queries do not have this option because they _always_ traverse into descendants.

## Decorator-based queries
TIP: While the Angular team recommends using the signal-based query function for new projects, the
original decorator-based query APIs remain fully supported.

You can alternatively declare queries by adding the corresponding decorator to a property. Decorator-based queries behave the same way as signal-based queries except as described below.

### View queries

You can query for a single result with the `@ViewChild` decorator.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 16, 17, 18]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card-header',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomCardHeader {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: '<custom-card-header>Visit sunny California!</custom-card-header>',
})
export class CustomCard {
  @ViewChild(CustomCardHeader) header: CustomCardHeader;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log(this.header.text);
  }
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the `CustomCard` component queries for a child `CustomCardHeader` and accesses the result in `ngAfterViewInit`.

Angular keeps the result of `@ViewChild` up to date as your application state changes.

**View query results become available in the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle method**. Before this point, the value is `undefined`. See the [Lifecycle](guide/components/lifecycle) section for details on the component lifecycle.

You can also query for multiple results with the `@ViewChildren` decorator.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card-action',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomCardAction {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: `
    <custom-card-action>Save</custom-card-action>
    <custom-card-action>Cancel</custom-card-action>
  `,
})
export class CustomCard {
  @ViewChildren(CustomCardAction) actions: QueryList<CustomCardAction>;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.actions.forEach(action => {
      console.log(action.text);
    });
  }
}
</docs-code>

`@ViewChildren` creates a `QueryList` object that contains the query results. You can subscribe to changes to the query results over time via the `changes` property.

### Content queries

You can query for a single result with the `@ContentChild` decorator.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 16, 17, 18, 25]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-toggle',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomToggle {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-expando',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomExpando {
  @ContentChild(CustomToggle) toggle: CustomToggle;

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log(this.toggle.text);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <custom-expando>
      <custom-toggle>Show</custom-toggle>
    </custom-expando>
  `
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

In this example, the `CustomExpando` component queries for a child `CustomToggle` and accesses the result in `ngAfterContentInit`.

Angular keeps the result of `@ContentChild` up to date as your application state changes.

**Content query results become available in the `ngAfterContentInit` lifecycle method**. Before this point, the value is `undefined`. See the [Lifecycle](guide/components/lifecycle) section for details on the component lifecycle.

You can also query for multiple results with the `@ContentChildren` decorator.

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]">
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-menu-item',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomMenuItem {
  text: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'custom-menu',
  /*...*/
})
export class CustomMenu {
  @ContentChildren(CustomMenuItem) items: QueryList<CustomMenuItem>;

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      console.log(item.text);
    });
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'user-profile',
  template: `
    <custom-menu>
      <custom-menu-item>Cheese</custom-menu-item>
      <custom-menu-item>Tomato</custom-menu-item>
    </custom-menu>
  `
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

`@ContentChildren` creates a `QueryList` object that contains the query results. You can subscribe to changes to the query results over time via the `changes` property.

### Decorator-based query options

All query decorators accept an options object as a second parameter. These options work the same way as signal-based queries except where described below.

### Static queries

`@ViewChild` and `@ContentChild` decorators accept the `static` option.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'custom-card',
  template: '<custom-card-header>Visit sunny California!</custom-card-header>',
})
export class CustomCard {
  @ViewChild(CustomCardHeader, {static: true}) header: CustomCardHeader;

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.header.text);
  }
}
```

By setting `static: true`, you guarantee to Angular that the target of this query is _always_ present and is not conditionally rendered. This makes the result available earlier, in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle method.

Static query results do not update after initialization.

The `static` option is not available for `@ViewChildren` and `@ContentChildren` queries.

### Using QueryList

`@ViewChildren` and `@ContentChildren` both provide a `QueryList` object that contains a list of results.

`QueryList` offers a number of convenience APIs for working with results in an array-like manner, such as `map`, `reduce`, and `forEach`. You can get an array of the current results by calling `toArray`.

You can subscribe to the `changes` property to do something any time the results change.

## Common query pitfalls

When using queries, common pitfalls can make your code harder to understand and maintain.

Always maintain a single source of truth for state shared between multiple components. This avoids scenarios where repeated state in different components becomes out of sync.

Avoid directly writing state to child components. This pattern can lead to brittle code that is hard to understand and is prone to [ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked](errors/NG0100) errors.

Never directly write state to parent or ancestor components. This pattern can lead to brittle code that is hard to understand and is prone to [ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked](errors/NG0100) errors.

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/selectors.md
================================================
# Component selectors

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Every component defines
a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) that determines how
the component is used:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  ...
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

You use a component by creating a matching HTML element in the templates of _other_ components:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({
  template: `
    <profile-photo />
    <button>Upload a new profile photo</button>`,
  ...,
})
export class UserProfile { }
</docs-code>

**Angular matches selectors statically at compile-time**. Changing the DOM at run-time, either via
Angular bindings or with DOM APIs, does not affect the components rendered.

**An element can match exactly one component selector.** If multiple component selectors match a
single element, Angular reports an error.

**Component selectors are case-sensitive.**

## Types of selectors

Angular supports a limited subset
of [basic CSS selector types](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) in
component selectors:

| **Selector type**  | **Description**                                                                                                 | **Examples**                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Type selector      | Matches elements based on their HTML tag name, or node name.                                                    | `profile-photo`               |
| Attribute selector | Matches elements based on the presence of an HTML attribute and, optionally, an exact value for that attribute. | `[dropzone]` `[type="reset"]` |
| Class selector     | Matches elements based on the presence of a CSS class.                                                          | `.menu-item`                  |

For attribute values, Angular supports matching an exact attribute value with the equals (`=`)
operator. Angular does not support other attribute value operators.

Angular component selectors do not support combinators, including
the [descendant combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator)
or [child combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator).

Angular component selectors do not support
specifying [namespaces](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course).

### The `:not` pseudo-class

Angular supports [the `:not` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:not).
You can append this pseudo-class to any other selector to narrow which elements a component's
selector matches. For example, you could define a `[dropzone]` attribute selector and prevent
matching `textarea` elements:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: '[dropzone]:not(textarea)',
  ...
})
export class DropZone { }
</docs-code>

Angular does not support any other pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements in component selectors.

### Combining selectors

You can combine multiple selectors by concatenating them. For example, you can match `<button>`
elements that specify `type="reset"`:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'button[type="reset"]',
  ...
})
export class ResetButton { }
</docs-code>

You can also define multiple selectors with a comma-separated list:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'drop-zone, [dropzone]',
  ...
})
export class DropZone { }
</docs-code>

Angular creates a component for each element that matches _any_ of the selectors in the list.

## Choosing a selector

The vast majority of components should use a custom element name as their selector. All custom
element names should include a hyphen as described
by [the HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name).
By default, Angular reports an error if it encounters a custom tag name that does not match any
available components, preventing bugs due to mistyped component names.

See [Advanced component configuration](guide/components/advanced-configuration) for details on
using [native custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components) in
Angular templates.

### Selector prefixes

The Angular team recommends using a short, consistent prefix for all the custom components
defined inside your project. For example, if you were to build YouTube with Angular, you might
prefix your components with `yt-`, with components like `yt-menu`, `yt-player`, etc. Namespacing
your selectors like this makes it immediately clear where a particular component comes from. By
default, the Angular CLI uses `app-`.

Angular uses the `ng` selector prefix for its own framework APIs. Never use `ng` as a selector
prefix for your own custom components.

### When to use an attribute selector

You should consider an attribute selector when you want to create a component on a standard native
element. For example, if you want to create a custom button component, you can take advantage of the
standard `<button>` element by using an attribute selector:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[2]">
@Component({
  selector: 'button[yt-upload]',
   ...
})
export class YouTubeUploadButton { }
</docs-code>

This approach allows consumers of the component to directly use all the element's standard APIs
without extra work. This is especially valuable for ARIA attributes such as `aria-label`.

Angular does not report errors when it encounters custom attributes that don't match an available
component. When using components with attribute selectors, consumers may forget to import the
component or its NgModule, resulting in the component not rendering.
See [Importing and using components](guide/components/importing) for more information.

Components that define attribute selectors should use lowercase, dash-case attributes. You can
follow the same prefixing recommendation described above.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/components/styling.md
================================================
# Styling components

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [Essentials Guide](essentials). Read that first if you're new to Angular.

Components can optionally include CSS styles that apply to that component's DOM:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  template: `<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Your profile photo">`,
  styles: ` img { border-radius: 50%; } `,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

You can also choose to write your styles in separate files:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
  templateUrl: 'profile-photo.html',
  styleUrl: 'profile-photo.css',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

When Angular compiles your component, these styles are emitted with your component's JavaScript
output. This means that component styles participate in the JavaScript module system. When you
render an Angular component, the framework automatically includes its associated styles, even when
lazy-loading a component.

Angular works with any tool that outputs CSS,
including [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [less](https://lesscss.org),
and [stylus](https://stylus-lang.com).

## Style scoping

Every component has a **view encapsulation** setting that determines how the framework scopes a
component's styles. There are three view encapsulation modes: `Emulated`, `ShadowDom`, and `None`.
You can specify the mode in the `@Component` decorator:

<docs-code language="angular-ts" highlight="[3]">
@Component({
  ...,
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
</docs-code>

### ViewEncapsulation.Emulated

By default, Angular uses emulated encapsulation so that a component's styles only apply to elements
defined in that component's template. In this mode, the framework generates a unique HTML attribute
for each component instance, adds that attribute to elements in the component's template, and
inserts that attribute into the CSS selectors defined in your component's styles.

This mode ensures that a component's styles do not leak out and affect other components. However,
global styles defined outside of a component may still affect elements inside a component with
emulated encapsulation.

In emulated mode, Angular supports
the [`:host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:host)
and [`:host-context()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:host-context) pseudo
classes without
using [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
During compilation, the framework transforms these pseudo classes into attributes so it doesn't
comply with these native pseudo classes' rules at runtime (e.g. browser compatibility, specificity). Angular's
emulated encapsulation mode does not support any other pseudo classes related to Shadow DOM, such
as `::shadow` or `::part`.

#### `::ng-deep`

Angular's emulated encapsulation mode supports a custom pseudo class, `::ng-deep`. Applying this
pseudo class to a CSS rule disables encapsulation for that rule, effectively turning it into a
global style. **The Angular team strongly discourages new use of `::ng-deep`**. These APIs remain
exclusively for backwards compatibility.

### ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom

This mode scopes styles within a component by
using [the web standard Shadow DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
When enabling this mode, Angular attaches a shadow root to the component's host element and renders
the component's template and styles into the corresponding shadow tree.

This mode strictly guarantees that _only_ that component's styles apply to elements in the
component's template. Global styles cannot affect elements in a shadow tree and styles inside the
shadow tree cannot affect elements outside of that shadow tree.

Enabling `ShadowDom` encapsulation, however, impacts more than style scoping. Rendering the
component in a shadow tree affects event propagation, interaction
with [the `<slot>` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots),
and how browser developer tools show elements. Always understand the full implications of using
Shadow DOM in your application before enabling this option.

### ViewEncapsulation.None

This mode disables all style encapsulation for the component. Any styles associated with the
component behave as global styles.

NOTE: In `Emulated` and `ShadowDom` modes, Angular doesn't 100% guarantee that your component's styles will always override styles coming from outside it.
It is assumed that these styles have the same specificity as your component's styles in case of collision.

## Defining styles in templates

You can use the `<style>` element in a component's template to define additional styles. The
component's view encapsulation mode applies to styles defined this way.

Angular does not support bindings inside of style elements.

## Referencing external style files

Component templates can
use [the `<link>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) to
reference CSS files. Additionally, your CSS may
use [the `@import`at-rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@import) to reference
CSS files. Angular treats these references as _external_ styles. External styles are not affected by
emulated view encapsulation.

# Creating an injectable service

Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an application needs.
A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose.
A component is one type of class that can use DI.

Angular distinguishes components from services to increase modularity and reusability.
By separating a component's view-related features from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes lean and efficient.

Ideally, a component's job is to enable the user experience and nothing more.
A component should present properties and methods for data binding, to mediate between the view (rendered by the template) and the application logic (which often includes some notion of a model).

A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console.
By defining such processing tasks in an injectable service class, you make those tasks available to any component.
You can also make your application more adaptable by configuring different providers of the same kind of service, as appropriate in different circumstances.

Angular does not enforce these principles.
Angular helps you follow these principles by making it easy to factor your application logic into services and make those services available to components through DI.

## Service examples

Here's an example of a service class that logs to the browser console:

<docs-code header="src/app/logger.service.ts (class)" language="typescript">
export class Logger {
  log(msg: unknown) { console.log(msg); }
  error(msg: unknown) { console.error(msg); }
  warn(msg: unknown) { console.warn(msg); }
}
</docs-code>

Services can depend on other services.
For example, here's a `HeroService` that depends on the `Logger` service, and also uses `BackendService` to get heroes.
That service in turn might depend on the `HttpClient` service to fetch heroes asynchronously from a server:

<docs-code header="src/app/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[7,8,12,13]">
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class HeroService {
  private heroes: Hero[] = [];

  private backend = inject(BackendService);
  private logger = inject(Logger);

  async getHeroes() {
    // Fetch
    this.heroes = await this.backend.getAll(Hero);
    // Log
    this.logger.log(`Fetched ${this.heroes.length} heroes.`);
    return this.heroes;
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Creating an injectable service

The Angular CLI provides a command to create a new service. In the following example, you add a new service to an existing application.

To generate a new `HeroService` class in the `src/app/heroes` folder, follow these steps:

1. Run this [Angular CLI](/tools/cli) command:

<docs-code language="sh">
ng generate service heroes/hero
</docs-code>

This command creates the following default `HeroService`:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts (CLI-generated)" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {}
</docs-code>

The `@Injectable()` decorator specifies that Angular can use this class in the DI system.
The metadata, `providedIn: 'root'`, means that the `HeroService` is provided throughout the application.

Add a `getHeroes()` method that returns the heroes from `mock.heroes.ts` to get the hero mock data:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';

@Injectable({
  // declares that this service should be created
  // by the root application injector.
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {
  getHeroes() {
    return HEROES;
  }
}
</docs-code>

For clarity and maintainability, it is recommended that you define components and services in separate files.

## Injecting services

To inject a service as a dependency into a component, you can declare a class field representing the dependency and use Angular's `inject` function to initialize it.

The following example specifies the `HeroService` in the `HeroListComponent`.
The type of `heroService` is `HeroService`.

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts" language="typescript">
import { inject } from "@angular/core";

export class HeroListComponent {
  private heroService = inject(HeroService);
}
</docs-code>

It is also possible to inject a service into a component using the component's constructor:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero-list.component.ts (constructor signature)" language="typescript">
  constructor(private heroService: HeroService)
</docs-code>

The `inject` method can be used in both classes and functions, while the constructor method can naturally only be used in a class constructor. However, in either case a dependency may only be injected in a valid [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context), usually in the construction or initialization of a component.

## Injecting services in other services

When a service depends on another service, follow the same pattern as injecting into a component.
In the following example, `HeroService` depends on a `Logger` service to report its activities:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[3,9,12]">
import { inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HEROES } from './mock-heroes';
import { Logger } from '../logger.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {
  private logger = inject(Logger);

  getHeroes() {
    this.logger.log('Getting heroes.');
    return HEROES;
  }
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the `getHeroes()` method uses the `Logger` service by logging a message when fetching heroes.

================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/di/dependency-injection-context.md
================================================
# Injection context

The dependency injection (DI) system relies internally on a runtime context where the current injector is available.
This means that injectors can only work when code is executed in such a context.

The injection context is available in these situations:

* During construction (via the `constructor`) of a class being instantiated by the DI system, such as an `@Injectable` or `@Component`.
* In the initializer for fields of such classes.
* In the factory function specified for `useFactory` of a `Provider` or an `@Injectable`.
* In the `factory` function specified for an `InjectionToken`.
* Within a stack frame that runs in an injection context.

Knowing when you are in an injection context will allow you to use the [`inject`](api/core/inject) function to inject instances.

## Class constructors

Every time the DI system instantiates a class, it does so in an injection context. This is handled by the framework itself. The constructor of the class is executed in that runtime context, which also allows injection of a token using the [`inject`](api/core/inject) function.

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[[3],[6]]">
class MyComponent  {
  private service1: Service1;
  private service2: Service2 = inject(Service2); // In context

  constructor() {
    this.service1 = inject(Service1) // In context
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Stack frame in context

Some APIs are designed to be run in an injection context. This is the case, for example, with router guards. This allows the use of [`inject`](api/core/inject) within the guard function to access a service.

Here is an example for `CanActivateFn`

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
const canActivateTeam: CanActivateFn =
    (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => {
      return inject(PermissionsService).canActivate(inject(UserToken), route.params.id);
    };
</docs-code>

## Run within an injection context

When you want to run a given function in an injection context without already being in one, you can do so with `runInInjectionContext`.
This requires access to a given injector, like the `EnvironmentInjector`, for example:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[9]">
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class HeroService {
  private environmentInjector = inject(EnvironmentInjector);

  someMethod() {
    runInInjectionContext(this.environmentInjector, () => {
      inject(SomeService); // Do what you need with the injected service
    });
  }
}
</docs-code>

Note that `inject` will return an instance only if the injector can resolve the required token.

## Asserts the context

Angular provides the `assertInInjectionContext` helper function to assert that the current context is an injection context.

## Using DI outside of a context

Calling [`inject`](api/core/inject) or calling `assertInInjectionContext` outside of an injection context will throw [error NG0203](/errors/NG0203).

================================================
# Configuring dependency providers

The previous sections described how to use class instances as dependencies.
Aside from classes, you can also use values such as `boolean`, `string`, `Date`, and objects as dependencies.
Angular provides the necessary APIs to make the dependency configuration flexible, so you can make those values available in DI.

## Specifying a provider token

If you specify the service class as the provider token, the default behavior is for the injector to instantiate that class using the `new` operator.

In the following example, the app component provides a `Logger` instance:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
providers: [Logger],
</docs-code>

You can, however, configure DI to associate the `Logger` provider token with a different class or any other value.
So when the `Logger` is injected, the configured value is used instead.

In fact, the class provider syntax is a shorthand expression that expands into a provider configuration, defined by the `Provider` interface.
Angular expands the `providers` value in this case into a full provider object as follows:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
[{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }]
</docs-code>

The expanded provider configuration is an object literal with two properties:

- The `provide` property holds the token that serves as the key for consuming the dependency value.
- The second property is a provider definition object, which tells the injector **how** to create the dependency value. The provider-definition can be one of the following:
  - `useClass` - this option tells Angular DI to instantiate a provided class when a dependency is injected
  - `useExisting` - allows you to alias a token and reference any existing one.
  - `useFactory` - allows you to define a function that constructs a dependency.
  - `useValue` - provides a static value that should be used as a dependency.

The sections below describe how to use the different provider definitions.

### Class providers: useClass

The `useClass` provider key lets you create and return a new instance of the specified class.

You can use this type of provider to substitute an alternative implementation for a common or default class.
The alternative implementation can, for example, implement a different strategy, extend the default class, or emulate the behavior of the real class in a test case.

In the following example, `BetterLogger` would be instantiated when the `Logger` dependency is requested in a component or any other class:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
[{ provide: Logger, useClass: BetterLogger }]
</docs-code>

If the alternative class providers have their own dependencies, specify both providers in the providers metadata property of the parent module or component:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
[
  UserService, // dependency needed in `EvenBetterLogger`.
  { provide: Logger, useClass: EvenBetterLogger },
]
</docs-code>

In this example, `EvenBetterLogger` displays the user name in the log message. This logger gets the user from an injected `UserService` instance:

<docs-code header="src/app/even-better-logger.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[3],[6]]">
@Injectable()
export class EvenBetterLogger extends Logger {
  private userService = inject(UserService);

  override log(message: string) {
    const name = this.userService.user.name;
    super.log(`Message to ${name}: ${message}`);
  }
}
</docs-code>

Angular DI knows how to construct the `UserService` dependency, since it has been configured above and is available in the injector.

### Alias providers: useExisting

The `useExisting` provider key lets you map one token to another.
In effect, the first token is an alias for the service associated with the second token, creating two ways to access the same service object.

In the following example, the injector injects the singleton instance of `NewLogger` when the component asks for either the new or the old logger:
In this way, `OldLogger` is an alias for `NewLogger`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
[
  NewLogger,
  // Alias OldLogger w/ reference to NewLogger
  { provide: OldLogger, useExisting: NewLogger},
]
</docs-code>

NOTE: Ensure you do not alias `OldLogger` to `NewLogger` with `useClass`, as this creates two different `NewLogger` instances.

### Factory providers: useFactory

The `useFactory` provider key lets you create a dependency object by calling a factory function.
With this approach, you can create a dynamic value based on information available in the DI and elsewhere in the app.

In the following example, only authorized users should see secret heroes in the `HeroService`.
Authorization can change during the course of a single application session, as when a different user logs in .

To keep security-sensitive information in `UserService` and out of `HeroService`, give the `HeroService` constructor a boolean flag to control display of secret heroes:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[4],[7]]">
class HeroService {
  constructor(
    private logger: Logger,
    private isAuthorized: boolean) { }

  getHeroes() {
    const auth = this.isAuthorized ? 'authorized' : 'unauthorized';
    this.logger.log(`Getting heroes for ${auth} user.`);
    return HEROES.filter(hero => this.isAuthorized || !hero.isSecret);
  }
}
</docs-code>

To implement the `isAuthorized` flag, use a factory provider to create a new logger instance for `HeroService`.
This is necessary as we need to manually pass `Logger` when constructing the hero service:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts" language="typescript">
const heroServiceFactory = (logger: Logger, userService: UserService) =>
  new HeroService(logger, userService.user.isAuthorized);
</docs-code>

The factory function has access to `UserService`.
You inject both `Logger` and `UserService` into the factory provider so the injector can pass them along to the factory function:

<docs-code header="src/app/heroes/hero.service.provider.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[3,4]">
export const heroServiceProvider = {
  provide: HeroService,
  useFactory: heroServiceFactory,
  deps: [Logger, UserService]
};
</docs-code>

- The `useFactory` field specifies that the provider is a factory function whose implementation is `heroServiceFactory`.
- The `deps` property is an array of provider tokens.
The `Logger` and `UserService` classes serve as tokens for their own class providers.
The injector resolves these tokens and injects the corresponding services into the matching `heroServiceFactory` factory function parameters, based on the order specified.

Capturing the factory provider in the exported variable, `heroServiceProvider`, makes the factory provider reusable.

### Value providers: useValue

The `useValue` key lets you associate a static value with a DI token.

Use this technique to provide runtime configuration constants such as website base addresses and feature flags.
You can also use a value provider in a unit test to provide mock data in place of a production data service.

The next section provides more information about the `useValue` key.

## Using an `InjectionToken` object

Use an `InjectionToken` object as provider token for non-class dependencies.
The following example defines a token, `APP_CONFIG`. of the type `InjectionToken`:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.config.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export interface AppConfig {
  title: string;
}

export const APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>('app.config description');
</docs-code>

The optional type parameter, `<AppConfig>`, and the token description, `app.config description`, specify the token's purpose.

Next, register the dependency provider in the component using the `InjectionToken` object of `APP_CONFIG`:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
const MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE: AppConfig = {
  title: 'Hello',
};

providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE }]
</docs-code>

Now, inject the configuration object in the constructor body with the `inject` function:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[2]">
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
    const config = inject(APP_CONFIG);
    this.title = config.title;
  }
}
</docs-code>

### Interfaces and DI

Though the TypeScript `AppConfig` interface supports typing within the class, the `AppConfig` interface plays no role in DI.
In TypeScript, an interface is a design-time artifact, and does not have a runtime representation, or token, that the DI framework can use.

When the TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript, the interface disappears because JavaScript doesn't have interfaces.
Because there is no interface for Angular to find at runtime, the interface cannot be a token, nor can you inject it:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
// Can't use interface as provider token
[{ provide: AppConfig, useValue: MY_APP_CONFIG_VARIABLE })]
</docs-code>

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
export class AppComponent {
  // Can't inject using the interface as the parameter type
  private config = inject(AppConfig);
}
</docs-code>

================================================
# Understanding dependency injection

Dependency injection, or DI, is one of the fundamental concepts in Angular. DI is wired into the Angular framework and allows classes with Angular decorators, such as Components, Directives, Pipes, and Injectables, to configure dependencies that they need.

Two main roles exist in the DI system: dependency consumer and dependency provider.

Angular facilitates the interaction between dependency consumers and dependency providers using an abstraction called `Injector`. When a dependency is requested, the injector checks its registry to see if there is an instance already available there. If not, a new instance is created and stored in the registry. Angular creates an application-wide injector (also known as the "root" injector) during the application bootstrap process. In most cases you don't need to manually create injectors, but you should know that there is a layer that connects providers and consumers.

This topic covers basic scenarios of how a class can act as a dependency. Angular also allows you to use functions, objects, primitive types such as string or Boolean, or any other types as dependencies. For more information, see [Dependency providers](guide/di/dependency-injection-providers).

## Providing a dependency

Consider a class called `HeroService` that needs to act as a dependency in a component.

The first step is to add the `@Injectable` decorator to show that the class can be injected.

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[1]">
@Injectable()
class HeroService {}
</docs-code>

The next step is to make it available in the DI by providing it.
A dependency can be provided in multiple places:

- [Understanding dependency injection](#understanding-dependency-injection)
  - [Providing a dependency](#providing-a-dependency)
    - [**Preferred**: At the application root level using `providedIn`](#preferred-at-the-application-root-level-using-providedin)
    - [At the Component level](#at-the-component-level)
    - [At the application root level using `ApplicationConfig`](#at-the-application-root-level-using-applicationconfig)
    - [`NgModule` based applications](#ngmodule-based-applications)
  - [Injecting/consuming a dependency](#injectingconsuming-a-dependency)
  - [What's next](#whats-next)

### **Preferred**: At the application root level using `providedIn`

Providing a service at the application root level using `providedIn` allows injecting the service into all other classes.
Using `providedIn` enables Angular and JavaScript code optimizers to effectively remove services that are unused (known as tree-shaking).

You can provide a service by using `providedIn: 'root'` in the `@Injectable` decorator:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[2]">
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
class HeroService {}
</docs-code>

When you provide the service at the root level, Angular creates a single, shared instance of the `HeroService` and injects it into any class that asks for it.

### At the Component level

You can provide services at `@Component` level by using the `providers` field of the `@Component` decorator.
In this case the `HeroService` becomes available to all instances of this component and other components and directives used in the template.

For example:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'hero-list',
  template: '...',
  providers: [HeroService]
})
class HeroListComponent {}
</docs-code>

When you register a provider at the component level, you get a new instance of the service with each new instance of that component.

NOTE: Declaring a service like this causes `HeroService` to always be included in your application— even if the service is unused.

### At the application root level using `ApplicationConfig`

You can use the `providers` field of the `ApplicationConfig` (passed to the `bootstrapApplication` function) to provide a service or other `Injectable` at the application level.

In the example below, the `HeroService` is available to all components, directives, and pipes:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
      { provide: HeroService },
    ]
};
</docs-code>

Then, in `main.ts`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
</docs-code>

NOTE: Declaring a service like this causes `HeroService` to always be included in your application— even if the service is unused.

### `NgModule` based applications

`@NgModule`-based applications use the `providers` field of the `@NgModule` decorator to provide a service or other `Injectable` available at the application level.

A service provided in a module is available to all declarations of the module, or to any other modules which share the same `ModuleInjector`.
To understand all edge-cases, see [Hierarchical injectors](guide/di/hierarchical-dependency-injection).

NOTE: Declaring a service using `providers` causes the service to be included in your application— even if the service is unused.

## Injecting/consuming a dependency

Use Angular's `inject` function to retrieve dependencies.

```ts
import {inject, Component} from 'angular/core';

@Component({/* ... */})
export class UserProfile {
  // You can use the `inject` function in property initializers.
  private userClient = inject(UserClient);

  constructor() {
    // You can also use the `inject` function in a constructor.
    const logger = inject(Logger);
  }
}
```

You can use the `inject` function in any [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context). Most of the time, this is in a class property initializer or a class constructor for components, directives, services, and pipes.

When Angular discovers that a component depends on a service, it first checks if the injector has any existing instances of that service. If a requested service instance doesn't yet exist, the injector creates one using the registered provider, and adds it to the injector before returning the service to Angular.

When all requested services have been resolved and returned, Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph Injector
serviceA[Service A]
heroService[HeroService]
serviceC[Service C]
serviceD[Service D]
end
direction TB
componentProperty["Component <br> heroService = inject(HeroService)"]
heroService-->componentProperty
style componentProperty text-align: left
```

================================================
# DI in action

This guide explores additional features of dependency injection in Angular.

## Custom providers with `@Inject`

Using a custom provider allows you to provide a concrete implementation for implicit dependencies, such as built-in browser APIs.
The following example uses an `InjectionToken` to provide the [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) browser API as a dependency in the `BrowserStorageService`:

<docs-code header="src/app/storage.service.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[3,6],[12]]">
import { Inject, Injectable, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export const BROWSER_STORAGE = new InjectionToken<Storage>('Browser Storage', {
  providedIn: 'root',
  factory: () => localStorage
});

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class BrowserStorageService {
  public storage = inject(BROWSER_STORAGE);

  get(key: string) {
    return this.storage.getItem(key);
  }

  set(key: string, value: string) {
    this.storage.setItem(key, value);
  }
}
</docs-code>

The `factory` function returns the `localStorage` property that is attached to the browser's window object.
The `inject` function initializes the `storage` property with an instance of the token.

This custom provider can now be overridden during testing with a mock API of `localStorage` instead of interacting with real browser APIs.

## Inject the component's DOM element

Although developers strive to avoid it, some visual effects and third-party tools require direct DOM access.
As a result, you might need to access a component's DOM element.

Angular exposes the underlying element of a `@Component` or `@Directive` via injection using the `ElementRef` injection token:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[7]">
import { Directive, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  private element = inject(ElementRef)

  update() {
    this.element.nativeElement.style.color = 'red';
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Resolve circular dependencies with a forward reference

The order of class declaration matters in TypeScript.
You can't refer directly to a class until it's been defined.

This isn't usually a problem, especially if you adhere to the recommended *one class per file* rule.
But sometimes circular references are unavoidable.
For example, when class 'A' refers to class 'B' and 'B' refers to 'A', one of them has to be defined first.

The Angular `forwardRef()` function creates an *indirect* reference that Angular can resolve later.

You face a similar problem when a class makes *a reference to itself*.
For example, in its `providers` array.
The `providers` array is a property of the `@Component()` decorator function, which must appear before the class definition.
You can break such circular references by using `forwardRef`.

<docs-code header="app.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
providers: [
  {
    provide: PARENT_MENU_ITEM,
    useExisting: forwardRef(() => MenuItem),
  },
],
</docs-code>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/di/hierarchical-dependency-injection.md
================================================
# Hierarchical injectors

Injectors in Angular have rules that you can leverage to achieve the desired visibility of injectables in your applications.
By understanding these rules, you can determine whether to declare a provider at the application level, in a Component, or in a Directive.

The applications you build with Angular can become quite large, and one way to manage this complexity is to split up the application into a well-defined tree of components.

There can be sections of your page that work in a completely independent way than the rest of the application, with its own local copies of the services and other dependencies that it needs.
Some of the services that these sections of the application use might be shared with other parts of the application, or with parent components that are further up in the component tree, while other dependencies are meant to be private.

With hierarchical dependency injection, you can isolate sections of the application and give them their own private dependencies not shared with the rest of the application, or have parent components share certain dependencies with its child components only but not with the rest of the component tree, and so on. Hierarchical dependency injection enables you to share dependencies between different parts of the application only when and if you need to.

## Types of injector hierarchies

Angular has two injector hierarchies:

| Injector hierarchies        | Details |
|:---                         |:---     |
| `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchy | Configure an `EnvironmentInjector` in this hierarchy using `@Injectable()` or `providers` array in `ApplicationConfig`. |
| `ElementInjector` hierarchy | Created implicitly at each DOM element. An `ElementInjector` is empty by default unless you configure it in the `providers` property on `@Directive()` or `@Component()`. |

<docs-callout title="NgModule Based Applications">
For `NgModule` based applications, you can provide dependencies with the `ModuleInjector` hierarchy using an `@NgModule()` or `@Injectable()` annotation.
</docs-callout>

### `EnvironmentInjector`

The `EnvironmentInjector` can be configured in one of two ways by using:

* The `@Injectable()` `providedIn` property to refer to `root` or `platform`
* The `ApplicationConfig` `providers` array

<docs-callout title="Tree-shaking and @Injectable()">

Using the `@Injectable()` `providedIn` property is preferable to using the `ApplicationConfig` `providers` array. With `@Injectable()` `providedIn`, optimization tools can perform tree-shaking, which removes services that your application isn't using. This results in smaller bundle sizes.

Tree-shaking is especially useful for a library because the application which uses the library may not have a need to inject it.

</docs-callout>

`EnvironmentInjector` is configured by the `ApplicationConfig.providers`.

Provide services using `providedIn` of `@Injectable()` as follows:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'  // <--provides this service in the root EnvironmentInjector
})
export class ItemService {
  name = 'telephone';
}

</docs-code>

The `@Injectable()` decorator identifies a service class.
The `providedIn` property configures a specific `EnvironmentInjector`, here `root`, which makes the service available in the `root` `EnvironmentInjector`.

### ModuleInjector

In the case of `NgModule` based applications, the ModuleInjector can be configured in one of two ways by using:

* The `@Injectable()` `providedIn` property to refer to `root` or `platform`
* The `@NgModule()` `providers` array

`ModuleInjector` is configured by the `@NgModule.providers` and `NgModule.imports` property. `ModuleInjector` is a flattening of all the providers arrays that can be reached by following the `NgModule.imports` recursively.

Child `ModuleInjector` hierarchies are created when lazy loading other `@NgModules`.

### Platform injector

There are two more injectors above `root`, an additional `EnvironmentInjector` and `NullInjector()`.

Consider how Angular bootstraps the application with the following in `main.ts`:

<docs-code language="javascript">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig);
</docs-code>

The `bootstrapApplication()` method creates a child injector of the platform injector which is configured by the `ApplicationConfig` instance.
This is the `root` `EnvironmentInjector`.

The `platformBrowserDynamic()` method creates an injector configured by a `PlatformModule`, which contains platform-specific dependencies.
This allows multiple applications to share a platform configuration.
For example, a browser has only one URL bar, no matter how many applications you have running.
You can configure additional platform-specific providers at the platform level by supplying `extraProviders` using the `platformBrowser()` function.

The next parent injector in the hierarchy is the `NullInjector()`, which is the top of the tree.
If you've gone so far up the tree that you are looking for a service in the `NullInjector()`, you'll get an error unless you've used `@Optional()` because ultimately, everything ends at the `NullInjector()` and it returns an error or, in the case of `@Optional()`, `null`.
For more information on `@Optional()`, see the [`@Optional()` section](#optional) of this guide.

The following diagram represents the relationship between the `root` `ModuleInjector` and its parent injectors as the previous paragraphs describe.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    elementInjector: EnvironmentInjector<br>(configured by Angular)<br>has special things like DomSanitizer => providedIn 'platform'
    rootInjector: root EnvironmentInjector<br>(configured by AppConfig)<br>has things for your app => bootstrapApplication(..., AppConfig)
    nullInjector: NullInjector<br>always throws an error unless<br>you use @Optional()

    direction BT
    rootInjector --> elementInjector
    elementInjector --> nullInjector
```

While the name `root` is a special alias, other `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchies don't have aliases.
You have the option to create `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchies whenever a dynamically loaded component is created, such as with the Router, which will create child `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchies.

All requests forward up to the root injector, whether you configured it with the `ApplicationConfig` instance passed to the `bootstrapApplication()` method, or registered all providers with `root` in their own services.

<docs-callout title="@Injectable() vs. ApplicationConfig">

If you configure an app-wide provider in the `ApplicationConfig` of `bootstrapApplication`, it overrides one configured for `root` in the `@Injectable()` metadata.
You can do this to configure a non-default provider of a service that is shared with multiple applications.

Here is an example of the case where the component router configuration includes a non-default [location strategy](guide/routing#location-strategy) by listing its provider in the `providers` list of the `ApplicationConfig`.

```ts
providers: [
  { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }
]
```

For `NgModule` based applications, configure app-wide providers in the `AppModule` `providers`.

</docs-callout>

### `ElementInjector`

Angular creates `ElementInjector` hierarchies implicitly for each DOM element.

Providing a service in the `@Component()` decorator using its `providers` or `viewProviders` property configures an `ElementInjector`.
For example, the following `TestComponent` configures the `ElementInjector` by providing the service as follows:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
@Component({
  …
  providers: [{ provide: ItemService, useValue: { name: 'lamp' } }]
})
export class TestComponent
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: See the [resolution rules](#resolution-rules) section to understand the relationship between the `EnvironmentInjector` tree, the `ModuleInjector` and the `ElementInjector` tree.

When you provide services in a component, that service is available by way of the `ElementInjector` at that component instance.
It may also be visible at child component/directives based on visibility rules described in the [resolution rules](#resolution-rules) section.

When the component instance is destroyed, so is that service instance.

#### `@Directive()` and `@Component()`

A component is a special type of directive, which means that just as `@Directive()` has a `providers` property, `@Component()` does too.
This means that directives as well as components can configure providers, using the `providers` property.
When you configure a provider for a component or directive using the `providers` property, that provider belongs to the `ElementInjector` of that component or directive.
Components and directives on the same element share an injector.

## Resolution rules

When resolving a token for a component/directive, Angular resolves it in two phases:

1. Against its parents in the `ElementInjector` hierarchy.
2. Against its parents in the `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchy.

When a component declares a dependency, Angular tries to satisfy that dependency with its own `ElementInjector`.
If the component's injector lacks the provider, it passes the request up to its parent component's `ElementInjector`.

The requests keep forwarding up until Angular finds an injector that can handle the request or runs out of ancestor `ElementInjector` hierarchies.

If Angular doesn't find the provider in any `ElementInjector` hierarchies, it goes back to the element where the request originated and looks in the `EnvironmentInjector` hierarchy.
If Angular still doesn't find the provider, it throws an error.

If you have registered a provider for the same DI token at different levels, the first one Angular encounters is the one it uses to resolve the dependency.
If, for example, a provider is registered locally in the component that needs a service,
Angular doesn't look for another provider of the same service.

HELPFUL: For `NgModule` based applications, Angular will search the `ModuleInjector` hierarchy if it cannot find a provider in the `ElementInjector` hierarchies.

## Resolution modifiers

Angular's resolution behavior can be modified with `optional`, `self`, `skipSelf` and `host`.
Import each of them from `@angular/core` and use each in the `inject` configuration when you inject your service.

### Types of modifiers

Resolution modifiers fall into three categories:

* What to do if Angular doesn't find what you're looking for, that is `optional`
* Where to start looking, that is `skipSelf`
* Where to stop looking, `host` and `self`

By default, Angular always starts at the current `Injector` and keeps searching all the way up.
Modifiers allow you to change the starting, or _self_, location and the ending location.

Additionally, you can combine all of the modifiers except:

* `host` and `self`
* `skipSelf` and `self`.

### `optional`

`optional` allows Angular to consider a service you inject to be optional.
This way, if it can't be resolved at runtime, Angular resolves the service as `null`, rather than throwing an error.
In the following example, the service, `OptionalService`, isn't provided in the service, `ApplicationConfig`, `@NgModule()`, or component class, so it isn't available anywhere in the app.

<docs-code header="src/app/optional/optional.component.ts" language="typescript">
export class OptionalComponent {
  public optional? = inject(OptionalService, {optional: true});
}
</docs-code>

### `self`

Use `self` so that Angular will only look at the `ElementInjector` for the current component or directive.

A good use case for `self` is to inject a service but only if it is available on the current host element.
To avoid errors in this situation, combine `self` with `optional`.

For example, in the following `SelfNoDataComponent`, notice the injected `LeafService` as a property.

<docs-code header="src/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[7]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-self-no-data',
  templateUrl: './self-no-data.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./self-no-data.component.css']
})
export class SelfNoDataComponent {
  public leaf = inject(LeafService, {optional: true, self: true});
}
</docs-code>

In this example, there is a parent provider and injecting the service will return the value, however, injecting the service with `self` and `optional` will return `null` because `self` tells the injector to stop searching in the current host element.

Another example shows the component class with a provider for `FlowerService`.
In this case, the injector looks no further than the current `ElementInjector` because it finds the `FlowerService` and returns the tulip <code>&#x1F337;</code>.

<docs-code header="src/app/self/self.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/resolution-modifiers/src/app/self/self.component.ts" visibleRegion="self-component"/>

### `skipSelf`

`skipSelf` is the opposite of `self`.
With `skipSelf`, Angular starts its search for a service in the parent `ElementInjector`, rather than in the current one.
So if the parent `ElementInjector` were using the fern <code>&#x1F33F;</code> value for `emoji`, but you had maple leaf <code>&#x1F341;</code> in the component's `providers` array, Angular would ignore maple leaf <code>&#x1F341;</code> and use fern <code>&#x1F33F;</code>.

To see this in code, assume that the following value for `emoji` is what the parent component were using, as in this service:

<docs-code header="src/app/leaf.service.ts" language="typescript">
export class LeafService {
  emoji = '🌿';
}
</docs-code>

Imagine that in the child component, you had a different value, maple leaf <code>&#x1F341;</code> but you wanted to use the parent's value instead.
This is when you'd use `skipSelf`:

<docs-code header="src/app/skipself/skipself.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[6],[10]]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-skipself',
  templateUrl: './skipself.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./skipself.component.css'],
  // Angular would ignore this LeafService instance
  providers: [{ provide: LeafService, useValue: { emoji: '🍁' } }]
})
export class SkipselfComponent {
  // Use skipSelf as inject option
  public leaf = inject(LeafService, {skipSelf: true});
}
</docs-code>

In this case, the value you'd get for `emoji` would be fern <code>&#x1F33F;</code>, not maple leaf <code>&#x1F341;</code>.

#### `skipSelf` option with `optional`

Use the `skipSelf` option with `optional` to prevent an error if the value is `null`.

In the following example, the `Person` service is injected during property initialization.
`skipSelf` tells Angular to skip the current injector and `optional` will prevent an error should the `Person` service be `null`.

<docs-code language="typescript">
class Person {
  parent = inject(Person, {optional: true, skipSelf: true})
}
</docs-code>

### `host`

<!-- TODO: Remove ambiguity between host and self. -->

`host` lets you designate a component as the last stop in the injector tree when searching for providers.

Even if there is a service instance further up the tree, Angular won't continue looking.
Use `host` as follows:

<docs-code header="src/app/host/host.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[6],[10]]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-host',
  templateUrl: './host.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./host.component.css'],
  //  provide the service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌷' } }]
})
export class HostComponent {
  // use host when injecting the service
  flower = inject(FlowerService, {host: true, optional: true});
}
</docs-code>

Since `HostComponent` has the `host` option , no matter what the parent of `HostComponent` might have as a `flower.emoji` value, the `HostComponent` will use tulip <code>&#x1F337;</code>.

### Modifiers with constructor injection  

Similarly as presented before, the behavior of constructor injection can be modified with `@Optional()`, `@Self()`, `@SkipSelf()` and `@Host()`.

Import each of them from `@angular/core` and use each in the component class constructor when you inject your service.

<docs-code header="src/app/self-no-data/self-no-data.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[3]">
export class SelfNoDataComponent {
  constructor(@Self() @Optional() public leaf?: LeafService) { }
}
</docs-code>

## Logical structure of the template

When you provide services in the component class, services are visible within the `ElementInjector` tree relative to where and how you provide those services.

Understanding the underlying logical structure of the Angular template will give you a foundation for configuring services and in turn control their visibility.

Components are used in your templates, as in the following example:

<docs-code language="html">
<app-root>
  <app-child></app-child>;
</app-root>
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: Usually, you declare the components and their templates in separate files.
For the purposes of understanding how the injection system works, it is useful to look at them from the point of view of a combined logical tree.
The term _logical_ distinguishes it from the render tree, which is your application's DOM tree.
To mark the locations of where the component templates are located, this guide uses the `<#VIEW>` pseudo-element, which doesn't actually exist in the render tree and is present for mental model purposes only.

The following is an example of how the `<app-root>` and `<app-child>` view trees are combined into a single logical tree:

<docs-code language="html">
<app-root>
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
     <#VIEW>
       …content goes here…
     </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
</docs-code>

Understanding the idea of the `<#VIEW>` demarcation is especially significant when you configure services in the component class.

## Example: Providing services in `@Component()`

How you provide services using a `@Component()` (or `@Directive()`) decorator determines their visibility.
The following sections demonstrate `providers` and `viewProviders` along with ways to modify service visibility with `skipSelf` and `host`.

A component class can provide services in two ways:

| Arrays                       | Details |
|:---                          |:---     |
| With a `providers` array     | `@Component({ providers: [SomeService] })`     |
| With a `viewProviders` array | `@Component({ viewProviders: [SomeService] })` |

In the examples below, you will see the logical tree of an Angular application.
To illustrate how the injector works in the context of templates, the logical tree will represent the HTML structure of the application.
For example, the logical tree will show that `<child-component>` is a direct children of `<parent-component>`.

In the logical tree, you will see special attributes: `@Provide`, `@Inject`, and `@ApplicationConfig`.
These aren't real attributes but are here to demonstrate what is going on under the hood.

| Angular service attribute                                                                                          | Details |
|:---                                                                                                                |:---     |
| `@Inject(Token)=>Value`     | If `Token` is injected at this location in the logical tree, its value would be `Value`.     |
| `@Provide(Token=Value)`     | Indicates that `Token` is provided with `Value` at this location in the logical tree.        |
| `@ApplicationConfig` | Demonstrates that a fallback `EnvironmentInjector` should be used at this location.          |

### Example app structure

The example application has a `FlowerService` provided in `root` with an `emoji` value of red hibiscus <code>&#x1F33A;</code>.

<docs-code header="src/app/flower.service.ts" language="typescript">
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class FlowerService {
  emoji = '🌺';
}
</docs-code>

Consider an application with only an `AppComponent` and a `ChildComponent`.
The most basic rendered view would look like nested HTML elements such as the following:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->
  <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
  </app-child>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

However, behind the scenes, Angular uses a logical view representation as follows when resolving injection requests:

<docs-code language="html">
<app-root> <!-- AppComponent selector -->
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child> <!-- ChildComponent selector -->
      <#VIEW>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>
</docs-code>

The `<#VIEW>` here represents an instance of a template.
Notice that each component has its own `<#VIEW>`.

Knowledge of this structure can inform how you provide and inject your services, and give you complete control of service visibility.

Now, consider that `<app-root>` injects the `FlowerService`:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript">
export class AppComponent  {
  flower = inject(FlowerService);
}
</docs-code>

Add a binding to the `<app-root>` template to visualize the result:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" language="html">
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
</docs-code>

The output in the view would be:

<docs-code language="shell">
Emoji from FlowerService: &#x1F33A;
</docs-code>

In the logical tree, this would be represented as follows:

<docs-code language="html" highlight="[[1],[2],[4]]">
<app-root @ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>"&#x1F33A;">
  <#VIEW>
    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (&#x1F33A;)</p>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

When `<app-root>` requests the `FlowerService`, it is the injector's job to resolve the `FlowerService` token.
The resolution of the token happens in two phases:

1. The injector determines the starting location in the logical tree and an ending location of the search.
    The injector begins with the starting location and looks for the token at each view level in the logical tree.
    If the token is found it is returned.

1. If the token is not found, the injector looks for the closest parent `EnvironmentInjector` to delegate the request to.

In the example case, the constraints are:

1. Start with `<#VIEW>` belonging to `<app-root>` and end with `<app-root>`.

    * Normally the starting point for search is at the point of injection.
        However, in this case `<app-root>` is a component. `@Component`s are special in that they also include their own `viewProviders`, which is why the search starts at `<#VIEW>` belonging to `<app-root>`.
        This would not be the case for a directive matched at the same location.
    * The ending location happens to be the same as the component itself, because it is the topmost component in this application.

1. The `EnvironmentInjector` provided by the `ApplicationConfig` acts as the fallback injector when the injection token can't be found in the `ElementInjector` hierarchies.

### Using the `providers` array

Now, in the `ChildComponent` class, add a provider for `FlowerService` to demonstrate more complex resolution rules in the upcoming sections:

<docs-code header="src/app/child.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[5,6],[10]]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],
  // use the providers array to provide a service
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  // inject the service
  flower = inject(FlowerService);
}
</docs-code>

Now that the `FlowerService` is provided in the `@Component()` decorator, when the `<app-child>` requests the service, the injector has only to look as far as the `ElementInjector` in the `<app-child>`.
It won't have to continue the search any further through the injector tree.

The next step is to add a binding to the `ChildComponent` template.

<docs-code header="src/app/child.component.html" language="html">
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
</docs-code>

To render the new values, add `<app-child>` to the bottom of the `AppComponent` template so the view also displays the sunflower:

<docs-code language="shell">
Child Component
Emoji from FlowerService: &#x1F33B;
</docs-code>

In the logical tree, this is represented as follows:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>"&#x1F33A;">
  <#VIEW>
    <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (&#x1F33A;)</p>
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService="&#x1F33B;")
               @Inject(FlowerService)=>"&#x1F33B;"> <!-- search ends here -->
      <#VIEW> <!-- search starts here -->
        <h2>Child Component</h2>
        <p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}} (&#x1F33B;)</p>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

When `<app-child>` requests the `FlowerService`, the injector begins its search at the `<#VIEW>` belonging to `<app-child>` \(`<#VIEW>` is included because it is injected from `@Component()`\) and ends with `<app-child>`.
In this case, the `FlowerService` is resolved in the `providers` array with sunflower <code>&#x1F33B;</code> of the `<app-child>`.
The injector doesn't have to look any further in the injector tree.
It stops as soon as it finds the `FlowerService` and never sees the red hibiscus <code>&#x1F33A;</code>.

### Using the `viewProviders` array

Use the `viewProviders` array as another way to provide services in the `@Component()` decorator.
Using `viewProviders` makes services visible in the `<#VIEW>`.

HELPFUL: The steps are the same as using the `providers` array, with the exception of using the `viewProviders` array instead.

For step-by-step instructions, continue with this section.
If you can set it up on your own, skip ahead to [Modifying service availability](#visibility-of-provided-tokens).

For demonstration, we are building an `AnimalService` to demonstrate `viewProviders`.
First, create an `AnimalService` with an `emoji` property of whale <code>&#x1F433;</code>:

<docs-code header="src/app/animal.service.ts" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AnimalService {
  emoji = '🐳';
}
</docs-code>

Following the same pattern as with the `FlowerService`, inject the `AnimalService` in the `AppComponent` class:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
export class AppComponent {
    public flower = inject(FlowerService);
    public animal = inject(AnimalService);
}
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: You can leave all the `FlowerService` related code in place as it will allow a comparison with the `AnimalService`.

Add a `viewProviders` array and inject the `AnimalService` in the `<app-child>` class, too, but give `emoji` a different value.
Here, it has a value of dog <code>&#x1F436;</code>.

<docs-code header="src/app/child.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[[7],[11]]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css'],
  // provide services
  providers: [{ provide: FlowerService, useValue: { emoji: '🌻' } }],
  viewProviders: [{ provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '🐶' } }]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  // inject services
  flower = inject(FlowerService); 
  animal = inject(AnimalService)
...
}
</docs-code>

Add bindings to the `ChildComponent` and the `AppComponent` templates.
In the `ChildComponent` template, add the following binding:

<docs-code header="src/app/child.component.html" language="html">
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
</docs-code>

Additionally, add the same to the `AppComponent` template:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" language="html">
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>s
</docs-code>

Now you should see both values in the browser:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

AppComponent
Emoji from AnimalService: &#x1F433;

Child Component
Emoji from AnimalService: &#x1F436;

</docs-code>

The logic tree for this example of `viewProviders` is as follows:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>"&#x1F433;">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F436;")
            @Inject(AnimalService=>"&#x1F436;")>
       <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
       <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (&#x1F436;)</p>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

Just as with the `FlowerService` example, the `AnimalService` is provided in the `<app-child>` `@Component()` decorator.
This means that since the injector first looks in the `ElementInjector` of the component, it finds the `AnimalService` value of dog <code>&#x1F436;</code>.
It doesn't need to continue searching the `ElementInjector` tree, nor does it need to search the `ModuleInjector`.

### `providers` vs. `viewProviders`

The `viewProviders` field is conceptually similar to `providers`, but there is one notable difference.
Configured providers in `viewProviders` are not visible to projected content that ends up as a logical children of the component.

To see the difference between using `providers` and `viewProviders`, add another component to the example and call it `InspectorComponent`.
`InspectorComponent` will be a child of the `ChildComponent`.
In `inspector.component.ts`, inject the `FlowerService` and `AnimalService` during property initialization:

<docs-code header="src/app/inspector/inspector.component.ts" language="typescript">
export class InspectorComponent {
  flower = inject(FlowerService);
  animal = inject(AnimalService);
}
</docs-code>

You do not need a `providers` or `viewProviders` array.
Next, in `inspector.component.html`, add the same markup from previous components:

<docs-code header="src/app/inspector/inspector.component.html" language="html">
<p>Emoji from FlowerService: {{flower.emoji}}</p>
<p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}}</p>
</docs-code>

Remember to add the `InspectorComponent` to the `ChildComponent` `imports` array.

<docs-code header="src/app/child/child.component.ts" language="typescript"
           highlight="[3]">
@Component({
  ...
  imports: [InspectorComponent]
})

</docs-code>

Next, add the following to `child.component.html`:

<docs-code header="src/app/child/child.component.html" language="html"
           highlight="[3,9]">
...

<div class="container">
  <h3>Content projection</h3>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
<h3>Inside the view</h3>

<app-inspector></app-inspector>
</docs-code>

`<ng-content>` allows you to project content, and `<app-inspector>` inside the `ChildComponent` template makes the `InspectorComponent` a child component of `ChildComponent`.

Next, add the following to `app.component.html` to take advantage of content projection.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" language="html" highlight="[2]">
<app-child>
  <app-inspector></app-inspector>
</app-child>
</docs-code>

The browser now renders the following, omitting the previous examples for brevity:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">
...
Content projection

Emoji from FlowerService: &#x1F33B;
Emoji from AnimalService: &#x1F433;

Emoji from FlowerService: &#x1F33B;
Emoji from AnimalService: &#x1F436;

</docs-code>

These four bindings demonstrate the difference between `providers` and `viewProviders`.
Remember that the dog emoji <code>&#x1F436;</code> is declared inside the `<#VIEW>` of `ChildComponent` and isn't visible to the projected content.
Instead, the projected content sees the whale <code>&#x1F433;</code>.

However, in the next output section though, the `InspectorComponent` is an actual child component of `ChildComponent`, `InspectorComponent` is inside the `<#VIEW>`, so when it asks for the `AnimalService`, it sees the dog <code>&#x1F436;</code>.

The `AnimalService` in the logical tree would look like this:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
         @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>"&#x1F433;">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F436;")
            @Inject(AnimalService=>"&#x1F436;")>
        <!-- ^^using viewProviders means AnimalService is available in <#VIEW>-->
        <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (&#x1F436;)</p>

        <div class="container">
          <h3>Content projection</h3>
          <app-inspector @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>"&#x1F433;">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (&#x1F433;)</p>
          </app-inspector>
        </div>

        <app-inspector>
          <#VIEW @Inject(AnimalService) animal=>"&#x1F436;">
            <p>Emoji from AnimalService: {{animal.emoji}} (&#x1F436;)</p>
          </#VIEW>
        </app-inspector>
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

The projected content of `<app-inspector>` sees the whale <code>&#x1F433;</code>, not the dog <code>&#x1F436;</code>, because the dog <code>&#x1F436;</code> is inside the `<app-child>` `<#VIEW>`.
The `<app-inspector>` can only see the dog <code>&#x1F436;</code> if it is also within the `<#VIEW>`.

### Visibility of provided tokens

Visibility decorators influence where the search for the injection token begins and ends in the logic tree.
To do this, place visibility configuration at the point of injection, that is, when invoking `inject()`, rather than at a point of declaration.

To alter where the injector starts looking for `FlowerService`, add `skipSelf` to the `<app-child>` `inject()` invocation where `FlowerService` is injected.
This invocation is a property initializer the `<app-child>` as shown in `child.component.ts`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
flower = inject(FlowerService, { skipSelf: true })
</docs-code>

With `skipSelf`, the `<app-child>` injector doesn't look to itself for the `FlowerService`.
Instead, the injector starts looking for the `FlowerService` at the `ElementInjector` of the `<app-root>`, where it finds nothing.
Then, it goes back to the `<app-child>` `ModuleInjector` and finds the red hibiscus <code>&#x1F33A;</code> value, which is available because `<app-child>` and `<app-root>` share the same `ModuleInjector`.
The UI renders the following:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Emoji from FlowerService: &#x1F33A;

</docs-code>

In a logical tree, this same idea might look like this:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>"&#x1F33A;">
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService="&#x1F33B;")>
      <#VIEW @Inject(FlowerService, SkipSelf)=>"&#x1F33A;">
        <!-- With SkipSelf, the injector looks to the next injector up the tree (app-root) -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

Though `<app-child>` provides the sunflower <code>&#x1F33B;</code>, the application renders the red hibiscus <code>&#x1F33A;</code> because `skipSelf` causes the current injector (`app-child`) to skip itself and look to its parent.

If you now add `host` (in addition to the `skipSelf`), the result will be `null`.
This is because `host` limits the upper bound of the search to the `app-child` `<#VIEW>`.
Here's the idea in the logical tree:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(FlowerService) flower=>"&#x1F33A;">
  <#VIEW> <!-- end search here with null-->
    <app-child @Provide(FlowerService="&#x1F33B;")> <!-- start search here -->
      <#VIEW inject(FlowerService, {skipSelf: true, host: true, optional:true})=>null>
      </#VIEW>
      </app-parent>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

Here, the services and their values are the same, but `host` stops the injector from looking any further than the `<#VIEW>` for `FlowerService`, so it doesn't find it and returns `null`.

### `skipSelf` and `viewProviders`

Remember, `<app-child>` provides the `AnimalService` in the `viewProviders` array with the value of dog <code>&#x1F436;</code>.
Because the injector has only to look at the `ElementInjector` of the `<app-child>` for the `AnimalService`, it never sees the whale <code>&#x1F433;</code>.

As in the `FlowerService` example, if you add `skipSelf` to the `inject()` of `AnimalService`, the injector won't look in the  `ElementInjector` of the current `<app-child>` for the `AnimalService`.
Instead, the injector will begin at the `<app-root>` `ElementInjector`.

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[5]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  …
  viewProviders: [
    { provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '&#x1F436;' } },
  ],
})
</docs-code>

The logical tree looks like this with `skipSelf` in `<app-child>`:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
          @Inject(AnimalService=>"&#x1F433;")>
  <#VIEW><!-- search begins here -->
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F436;")
             @Inject(AnimalService, SkipSelf=>"&#x1F433;")>
        <!--Add skipSelf -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

With `skipSelf` in the `<app-child>`, the injector begins its search for the `AnimalService` in the `<app-root>` `ElementInjector` and finds whale <code>&#x1F433;</code>.

### `host` and `viewProviders`

If you just use `host` for the injection of `AnimalService`, the result is dog <code>&#x1F436;</code> because the injector finds the `AnimalService` in the `<app-child>` `<#VIEW>` itself.
The `ChildComponent` configures the `viewProviders` so that the dog emoji is provided as `AnimalService` value.
You can also see `host` the `inject()`:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[[5],[9]]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  …
  viewProviders: [
    { provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '&#x1F436;' } },
  ]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  animal = inject(AnimalService, { host: true })
}
</docs-code>

`host: true` causes the injector to look until it encounters the edge of the `<#VIEW>`.

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
          @Inject(AnimalService=>"&#x1F433;")>
  <#VIEW>
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F436;")
             inject(AnimalService, {host: true}=>"&#x1F436;")> <!-- host stops search here -->
      </#VIEW>
    </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

Add a `viewProviders` array with a third animal, hedgehog <code>&#x1F994;</code>, to the `app.component.ts` `@Component()` metadata:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[6]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ],
  viewProviders: [
    { provide: AnimalService, useValue: { emoji: '&#x1F994;' } },
  ],
})

</docs-code>

Next, add `skipSelf` along with `host` to the `inject()` for the `AnimalService` injection in `child.component.ts`.
Here are `host` and `skipSelf` in the `animal` property initialization:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[4]">
export class ChildComponent {
  animal = inject(AnimalService, { host: true, skipSelf: true });
}

</docs-code>

<!-- TODO: This requires a rework. It seems not well explained what `viewProviders`/`injectors` is here
  and how `host` works.
 -->

When `host` and `skipSelf` were applied to the `FlowerService`, which is in the `providers` array, the result was `null` because `skipSelf` starts its search in the `<app-child>` injector, but `host` stops searching at `<#VIEW>` —where there is no `FlowerService`
In the logical tree, you can see that the `FlowerService` is visible in `<app-child>`, not its `<#VIEW>`.

However, the `AnimalService`, which is provided in the `AppComponent` `viewProviders` array, is visible.

The logical tree representation shows why this is:

<docs-code language="html">

<app-root @ApplicationConfig
        @Inject(AnimalService=>"&#x1F433;")>
  <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F994;")
         @Inject(AnimalService, @Optional)=>"&#x1F994;">
    <!-- ^^skipSelf starts here,  host stops here^^ -->
    <app-child>
      <#VIEW @Provide(AnimalService="&#x1F436;")
             inject(AnimalService, {skipSelf:true, host: true, optional: true})=>"&#x1F994;">
               <!-- Add skipSelf ^^-->
      </#VIEW>
      </app-child>
  </#VIEW>
</app-root>

</docs-code>

`skipSelf`, causes the injector to start its search for the `AnimalService` at the `<app-root>`, not the `<app-child>`, where the request originates, and `host` stops the search at the `<app-root>` `<#VIEW>`.
Since `AnimalService` is provided by way of the `viewProviders` array, the injector finds hedgehog <code>&#x1F994;</code> in the `<#VIEW>`.

## Example: `ElementInjector` use cases

The ability to configure one or more providers at different levels opens up useful possibilities.

### Scenario: service isolation

Architectural reasons may lead you to restrict access to a service to the application domain where it belongs.
For example, consider we build a `VillainsListComponent` that displays a list of villains.
It gets those villains from a `VillainsService`.

If you provide `VillainsService` in the root `AppModule`, it will make `VillainsService` visible everywhere in the application.
If you later modify the `VillainsService`, you could break something in other components that started depending this service by accident.

Instead, you should provide the `VillainsService` in the `providers` metadata of the `VillainsListComponent` like this:

<docs-code header="src/app/villains-list.component.ts (metadata)" language="typescript"
           highlight="[4]">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-villains-list',
  templateUrl: './villains-list.component.html',
  providers: [VillainsService]
})
export class VillainsListComponent {}
</docs-code>

By providing `VillainsService` in the `VillainsListComponent` metadata and nowhere else, the service becomes available only in the `VillainsListComponent` and its subcomponent tree.

`VillainService` is a singleton with respect to `VillainsListComponent` because that is where it is declared.
As long as `VillainsListComponent` does not get destroyed it will be the same instance of `VillainService` but if there are multiple instances of `VillainsListComponent`, then each instance of `VillainsListComponent` will have its own instance of `VillainService`.

### Scenario: multiple edit sessions

Many applications allow users to work on several open tasks at the same time.
For example, in a tax preparation application, the preparer could be working on several tax returns, switching from one to the other throughout the day.

To demonstrate that scenario, imagine a `HeroListComponent` that displays a list of super heroes.

To open a hero's tax return, the preparer clicks on a hero name, which opens a component for editing that return.
Each selected hero tax return opens in its own component and multiple returns can be open at the same time.

Each tax return component has the following characteristics:

* Is its own tax return editing session
* Can change a tax return without affecting a return in another component
* Has the ability to save the changes to its tax return or cancel them

Suppose that the `HeroTaxReturnComponent` had logic to manage and restore changes.
That would be a straightforward task for a hero tax return.
In the real world, with a rich tax return data model, the change management would be tricky.
You could delegate that management to a helper service, as this example does.

The `HeroTaxReturnService` caches a single `HeroTaxReturn`, tracks changes to that return, and can save or restore it.
It also delegates to the application-wide singleton `HeroService`, which it gets by injection.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-tax-return.service.ts" language="typescript">
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';
import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';

@Injectable()
export class HeroTaxReturnService {
  private currentTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;
  private originalTaxReturn!: HeroTaxReturn;

  private heroService = inject(HeroesService);

  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {
    this.originalTaxReturn = htr;
    this.currentTaxReturn  = htr.clone();
  }

  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {
    return this.currentTaxReturn;
  }

  restoreTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.originalTaxReturn;
  }

  saveTaxReturn() {
    this.taxReturn = this.currentTaxReturn;
    this.heroService.saveTaxReturn(this.currentTaxReturn).subscribe();
  }
}
</docs-code>

Here is the `HeroTaxReturnComponent` that makes use of `HeroTaxReturnService`.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts" language="typescript">
import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';
import { HeroTaxReturn } from './hero';
import { HeroTaxReturnService } from './hero-tax-return.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero-tax-return',
  templateUrl: './hero-tax-return.component.html',
  styleUrls: [ './hero-tax-return.component.css' ],
  providers: [ HeroTaxReturnService ]
})
export class HeroTaxReturnComponent {
  message = '';

  @Output() close = new EventEmitter<void>();

  get taxReturn(): HeroTaxReturn {
    return this.heroTaxReturnService.taxReturn;
  }

  @Input()
  set taxReturn(htr: HeroTaxReturn) {
    this.heroTaxReturnService.taxReturn = htr;
  }

  private heroTaxReturnService = inject(HeroTaxReturnService);

  onCanceled()  {
    this.flashMessage('Canceled');
    this.heroTaxReturnService.restoreTaxReturn();
  }

  onClose() { this.close.emit(); }

  onSaved() {
    this.flashMessage('Saved');
    this.heroTaxReturnService.saveTaxReturn();
  }

  flashMessage(msg: string) {
    this.message = msg;
    setTimeout(() => this.message = '', 500);
  }
}
</docs-code>

The _tax-return-to-edit_ arrives by way of the `@Input()` property, which is implemented with getters and setters.
The setter initializes the component's own instance of the `HeroTaxReturnService` with the incoming return.
The getter always returns what that service says is the current state of the hero.
The component also asks the service to save and restore this tax return.

This won't work if the service is an application-wide singleton.
Every component would share the same service instance, and each component would overwrite the tax return that belonged to another hero.

To prevent this, configure the component-level injector of `HeroTaxReturnComponent` to provide the service, using the `providers` property in the component metadata.

<docs-code header="src/app/hero-tax-return.component.ts (providers)" language="typescript">
providers: [HeroTaxReturnService]
</docs-code>

The `HeroTaxReturnComponent` has its own provider of the `HeroTaxReturnService`.
Recall that every component _instance_ has its own injector.
Providing the service at the component level ensures that _every_ instance of the component gets a private instance of the service. This makes sure that no tax return gets overwritten.

HELPFUL: The rest of the scenario code relies on other Angular features and techniques that you can learn about elsewhere in the documentation.

### Scenario: specialized providers

Another reason to provide a service again at another level is to substitute a _more specialized_ implementation of that service, deeper in the component tree.

For example, consider a `Car` component that includes tire service information and depends on other services to provide more details about the car.

The root injector, marked as (A), uses _generic_ providers for details about `CarService` and `EngineService`.

1. `Car` component (A).  Component (A) displays tire service data about a car and specifies generic services to provide more information about the car.

2. Child component (B). Component (B) defines its own, _specialized_ providers for `CarService` and `EngineService` that have special capabilities suitable for what's going on in component (B).

3. Child component (C) as a child of Component (B). Component (C) defines its own, even _more specialized_ provider for `CarService`.

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph COMPONENT_A[Component A]
subgraph COMPONENT_B[Component B]
COMPONENT_C[Component C]
end
end

style COMPONENT_A fill:#BDD7EE
style COMPONENT_B fill:#FFE699
style COMPONENT_C fill:#A9D18E,color:#000
classDef noShadow filter:none
class COMPONENT_A,COMPONENT_B,COMPONENT_C noShadow
```

Behind the scenes, each component sets up its own injector with zero, one, or more providers defined for that component itself.

When you resolve an instance of `Car` at the deepest component (C), its injector produces:

* An instance of `Car` resolved by injector (C)
* An `Engine` resolved by injector (B)
* Its `Tires` resolved by the root injector (A).

```mermaid
graph BT;

subgraph A[" "]
direction LR
RootInjector["(A) RootInjector"]
ServicesA["CarService, EngineService, TiresService"]
end

subgraph B[" "]
direction LR
ParentInjector["(B) ParentInjector"]
ServicesB["CarService2, EngineService2"]
end

subgraph C[" "]
direction LR
ChildInjector["(C) ChildInjector"]
ServicesC["CarService3"]
end

direction LR
car["(C) Car"]
engine["(B) Engine"]
tires["(A) Tires"]

direction BT

# Optimizing client application size with lightweight injection tokens

This page provides a conceptual overview of a dependency injection technique that is recommended for library developers.
Designing your library with *lightweight injection tokens* helps optimize the bundle size of client applications that use your library.

You can manage the dependency structure among your components and injectable services to optimize bundle size by using tree-shakable providers.
This normally ensures that if a provided component or service is never actually used by the application, the compiler can remove its code from the bundle.

Due to the way Angular stores injection tokens, it is possible that such an unused component or service can end up in the bundle anyway.
This page describes a dependency injection design pattern that supports proper tree-shaking by using lightweight injection tokens.

The lightweight injection token design pattern is especially important for library developers.
It ensures that when an application uses only some of your library's capabilities, the unused code can be eliminated from the client's application bundle.

When an application uses your library, there might be some services that your library supplies which the client application doesn't use.
In this case, the application developer should expect that service to be tree-shaken, and not contribute to the size of the compiled application.
Because the application developer cannot know about or remedy a tree-shaking problem in the library, it is the responsibility of the library developer to do so.
To prevent the retention of unused components, your library should use the lightweight injection token design pattern.

## When tokens are retained

To better explain the condition under which token retention occurs, consider a library that provides a library-card component.
This component contains a body and can contain an optional header:

<docs-code language="html">

<lib-card>;
  <lib-header>…</lib-header>;
</lib-card>;

</docs-code>

In a likely implementation, the `<lib-card>` component uses `@ContentChild()` or `@ContentChildren()` to get `<lib-header>` and `<lib-body>`, as in the following:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[12]">
@Component({
  selector: 'lib-header',
  …,
})
class LibHeaderComponent {}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-card',
  …,
})
class LibCardComponent {
  @ContentChild(LibHeaderComponent) header: LibHeaderComponent|null = null;
}

</docs-code>

Because `<lib-header>` is optional, the element can appear in the template in its minimal form, `<lib-card></lib-card>`.
In this case, `<lib-header>` is not used and you would expect it to be tree-shaken, but that is not what happens.
This is because `LibCardComponent` actually contains two references to the `LibHeaderComponent`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
@ContentChild(LibHeaderComponent) header: LibHeaderComponent;
</docs-code>

* One of these reference is in the *type position*-- that is, it specifies `LibHeaderComponent` as a type: `header: LibHeaderComponent;`.
* The other reference is in the *value position*-- that is, LibHeaderComponent is the value of the `@ContentChild()` parameter decorator: `@ContentChild(LibHeaderComponent)`.

The compiler handles token references in these positions differently:

* The compiler erases *type position* references after conversion from TypeScript, so they have no impact on tree-shaking.
* The compiler must keep *value position* references at runtime, which **prevents** the component from being tree-shaken.

In the example, the compiler retains the `LibHeaderComponent` token that occurs in the value position.
This prevents the referenced component from being tree-shaken, even if the application does not actually use `<lib-header>` anywhere.
If `LibHeaderComponent` 's code, template, and styles combine to become too large, including it unnecessarily can significantly increase the size of the client application.

## When to use the lightweight injection token pattern

The tree-shaking problem arises when a component is used as an injection token.
There are two cases when that can happen:

* The token is used in the value position of a [content query](guide/components/queries#content-queries).
* The token is used as a type specifier for constructor injection.

In the following example, both uses of the `OtherComponent` token cause retention of `OtherComponent`, preventing it from being tree-shaken when it is not used:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[[2],[4]]">
class MyComponent {
  constructor(@Optional() other: OtherComponent) {}

  @ContentChild(OtherComponent) other: OtherComponent|null;
}
</docs-code>

Although tokens used only as type specifiers are removed when converted to JavaScript, all tokens used for dependency injection are needed at runtime.
These effectively change `constructor(@Optional() other: OtherComponent)` to `constructor(@Optional() @Inject(OtherComponent) other)`.
The token is now in a value position, which causes the tree-shaker to keep the reference.

HELPFUL: Libraries should use [tree-shakable providers](guide/di/dependency-injection#providing-dependency) for all services, providing dependencies at the root level rather than in components or modules.

## Using lightweight injection tokens

The lightweight injection token design pattern consists of using a small abstract class as an injection token, and providing the actual implementation at a later stage.
The abstract class is retained, not tree-shaken, but it is small and has no material impact on the application size.

The following example shows how this works for the `LibHeaderComponent`:

<docs-code language="typescript" language="[[1],[6],[17]]">
abstract class LibHeaderToken {}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-header',
  providers: [
    {provide: LibHeaderToken, useExisting: LibHeaderComponent}
  ]
  …,
})
class LibHeaderComponent extends LibHeaderToken {}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-card',
  …,
})
class LibCardComponent {
  @ContentChild(LibHeaderToken) header: LibHeaderToken|null = null;
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the `LibCardComponent` implementation no longer refers to `LibHeaderComponent` in either the type position or the value position.
This lets full tree-shaking of `LibHeaderComponent` take place.
The `LibHeaderToken` is retained, but it is only a class declaration, with no concrete implementation.
It is small and does not materially impact the application size when retained after compilation.

Instead, `LibHeaderComponent` itself implements the abstract `LibHeaderToken` class.
You can safely use that token as the provider in the component definition, allowing Angular to correctly inject the concrete type.

To summarize, the lightweight injection token pattern consists of the following:

1. A lightweight injection token that is represented as an abstract class.
1. A component definition that implements the abstract class.
1. Injection of the lightweight pattern, using `@ContentChild()` or `@ContentChildren()`.
1. A provider in the implementation of the lightweight injection token which associates the lightweight injection token with the implementation.

### Use the lightweight injection token for API definition

A component that injects a lightweight injection token might need to invoke a method in the injected class.
The token is now an abstract class. Since the injectable component implements that class, you must also declare an abstract method in the abstract lightweight injection token class.
The implementation of the method, with all its code overhead, resides in the injectable component that can be tree-shaken.
This lets the parent communicate with the child, if it is present, in a type-safe manner.

For example, the `LibCardComponent` now queries `LibHeaderToken` rather than `LibHeaderComponent`.
The following example shows how the pattern lets `LibCardComponent` communicate with the `LibHeaderComponent` without actually referring to `LibHeaderComponent`:

<docs-code language="typescript" highlight="[[3],[13,16],[27]]">
abstract class LibHeaderToken {
  abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-header',
  providers: [
    {provide: LibHeaderToken, useExisting: LibHeaderComponent}
  ]
  …,
})
class LibHeaderComponent extends LibHeaderToken {
  doSomething(): void {
    // Concrete implementation of `doSomething`
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'lib-card',
  …,
})
class LibCardComponent implement AfterContentInit {
  @ContentChild(LibHeaderToken) header: LibHeaderToken|null = null;

  ngAfterContentInit(): void {
    if (this.header !== null) {
      this.header?.doSomething();
    }
  }
}
</docs-code>

In this example, the parent queries the token to get the child component, and stores the resulting component reference if it is present.
Before calling a method in the child, the parent component checks to see if the child component is present.
If the child component has been tree-shaken, there is no runtime reference to it, and no call to its method.

### Naming your lightweight injection token

Lightweight injection tokens are only useful with components.
The Angular style guide suggests that you name components using the "Component" suffix.
The example "LibHeaderComponent" follows this convention.

You should maintain the relationship between the component and its token while still distinguishing between them.
The recommended style is to use the component base name with the suffix "`Token`" to name your lightweight injection tokens: "`LibHeaderToken`."

TIP: Check out Angular's [Essentials](essentials/dependency-injection) before diving into this comprehensive guide.

When you develop a smaller part of your system, like a module or a class, you may need to use features from other classes. For example, you may need an HTTP service to make backend calls. Dependency Injection, or DI, is a design pattern and mechanism for creating and delivering some parts of an application to other parts of an application that require them. Angular supports this design pattern and you can use it in your applications to increase flexibility and modularity.

In Angular, dependencies are typically services, but they also can be values, such as strings or functions. An injector for an application (created automatically during bootstrap) instantiates dependencies when needed, using a configured provider of the service or value.

# Attribute directives

Change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements and Angular components with attribute directives.

## Building an attribute directive

This section walks you through creating a highlight directive that sets the background color of the host element to yellow.

1. To create a directive, use the CLI command [`ng generate directive`](tools/cli/schematics).

    <docs-code language="shell">

    ng generate directive highlight

    </docs-code>

    The CLI creates `src/app/highlight.directive.ts`, a corresponding test file `src/app/highlight.directive.spec.ts`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.0.ts"/>

    The `@Directive()` decorator's configuration property specifies the directive's CSS attribute selector, `[appHighlight]`.

1. Import `ElementRef` from `@angular/core`.
    `ElementRef` grants direct access to the host DOM element through its `nativeElement` property.

1. Add `ElementRef` in the directive's `constructor()` to [inject](guide/di) a reference to the host DOM element, the element to which you apply `appHighlight`.

1. Add logic to the `HighlightDirective` class that sets the background to yellow.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.1.ts"/>

HELPFUL: Directives *do not* support namespaces.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.avoid.html (unsupported)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.avoid.html" visibleRegion="unsupported"/>

## Applying an attribute directive

1. To use the `HighlightDirective`, add a `<p>` element to the HTML template with the directive as an attribute.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.1.html" visibleRegion="applied"/>

Angular creates an instance of the `HighlightDirective` class and injects a reference to the `<p>` element into the directive's constructor, which sets the `<p>` element's background style to yellow.

## Handling user events

This section shows you how to detect when a user mouses into or out of the element and to respond by setting or clearing the highlight color.

1. Import `HostListener` from '@angular/core'.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (imports)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts" visibleRegion="imports"/>

1. Add two event handlers that respond when the mouse enters or leaves, each with the `@HostListener()` decorator.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (mouse-methods)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts" visibleRegion="mouse-methods"/>

Subscribe to events of the DOM element that hosts an attribute directive, the `<p>` in this case, with the `@HostListener()` decorator.

HELPFUL: The handlers delegate to a helper method, `highlight()`, that sets the color on the host DOM element, `el`.

The complete directive is as follows:

<docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.2.ts"/>

The background color appears when the pointer hovers over the paragraph element and disappears as the pointer moves out.

<img alt="Second Highlight" src="assets/images/guide/attribute-directives/highlight-directive-anim.gif">

## Passing values into an attribute directive

This section walks you through setting the highlight color while applying the `HighlightDirective`.

1. In `highlight.directive.ts`, import `Input` from `@angular/core`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (imports)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.3.ts" visibleRegion="imports"/>

1. Add an `appHighlight` `@Input()` property.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.3.ts" visibleRegion="input"/>

    The `@Input()` decorator adds metadata to the class that makes the directive's `appHighlight` property available for binding.

1. In `app.component.ts`, add a `color` property to the `AppComponent`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (class)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="class"/>

1. To simultaneously apply the directive and the color, use property binding with the `appHighlight` directive selector, setting it equal to `color`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (color)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="color"/>

    The `[appHighlight]` attribute binding performs two tasks:

    * Applies the highlighting directive to the `<p>` element
    * Sets the directive's highlight color with a property binding

### Setting the value with user input

This section guides you through adding radio buttons to bind your color choice to the `appHighlight` directive.

1. Add markup to `app.component.html` for choosing a color as follows:

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (v2)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="v2"/>

1. Revise the `AppComponent.color` so that it has no initial value.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (class)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="class"/>

1. In `highlight.directive.ts`, revise `onMouseEnter` method so that it first tries to highlight with `appHighlight` and falls back to `red` if `appHighlight` is `undefined`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (mouse-enter)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.3.ts" visibleRegion="mouse-enter"/>

1. Serve your application to verify that the user can choose the color with the radio buttons.

    <img alt="Animated gif of the refactored highlight directive changing color according to the radio button the user selects" src="assets/images/guide/attribute-directives/highlight-directive-v2-anim.gif">

## Binding to a second property

This section guides you through configuring your application so the developer can set the default color.

1. Add a second `Input()` property to `HighlightDirective` called `defaultColor`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (defaultColor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.ts" visibleRegion="defaultColor"/>

1. Revise the directive's `onMouseEnter` so that it first tries to highlight with the `appHighlight`, then with the `defaultColor`, and falls back to `red` if both properties are `undefined`.

    <docs-code header="src/app/highlight.directive.ts (mouse-enter)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/highlight.directive.ts" visibleRegion="mouse-enter"/>

1. To bind to the `AppComponent.color` and fall back to "violet" as the default color, add the following HTML.
    In this case,  the `defaultColor` binding doesn't use square brackets, `[]`, because it is static.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (defaultColor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="defaultColor"/>

    As with components, you can add multiple directive property bindings to a host element.

The default color is red if there is no default color binding.
When the user chooses a color the selected color becomes the active highlight color.

<img alt="Animated gif of final highlight directive that shows red color with no binding and violet with the default color set. When user selects color, the selection takes precedence." src="assets/images/guide/attribute-directives/highlight-directive-final-anim.gif">

## Deactivating Angular processing with `NgNonBindable`

To prevent expression evaluation in the browser, add `ngNonBindable` to the host element.
`ngNonBindable` deactivates interpolation, directives, and binding in templates.

In the following example, the expression `{{ 1 + 1 }}` renders just as it does in your code editor, and does not display `2`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="ngNonBindable"/>

Applying `ngNonBindable` to an element stops binding for that element's child elements.
However, `ngNonBindable` still lets directives work on the element where you apply `ngNonBindable`.
In the following example, the `appHighlight` directive is still active but Angular does not evaluate the expression `{{ 1 + 1 }}`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/attribute-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="ngNonBindable-with-directive"/>

If you apply `ngNonBindable` to a parent element, Angular disables interpolation and binding of any sort, such as property binding or event binding, for the element's children.

================================================
# Directive composition API

Angular directives offer a great way to encapsulate reusable behaviors— directives can apply
attributes, CSS classes, and event listeners to an element.

The *directive composition API* lets you apply directives to a component's host element from
*within* the component TypeScript class.

## Adding directives to a component

You apply directives to a component by adding a `hostDirectives` property to a component's
decorator. We call such directives *host directives*.

In this example, we apply the directive `MenuBehavior` to the host element of `AdminMenu`. This
works similarly to applying the `MenuBehavior` to the `<admin-menu>` element in a template.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'admin-menu',
  template: 'admin-menu.html',
  hostDirectives: [MenuBehavior],
})
export class AdminMenu { }
```

When the framework renders a component, Angular also creates an instance of each host directive. The
directives' host bindings apply to the component's host element. By default, host directive inputs
and outputs are not exposed as part of the component's public API. See
[Including inputs and outputs](#including-inputs-and-outputs) below for more information.

**Angular applies host directives statically at compile time.** You cannot dynamically add
directives at runtime.

**Directives used in `hostDirectives` may not specify `standalone: false`.**

**Angular ignores the `selector` of directives applied in the `hostDirectives` property.**

## Including inputs and outputs

When you apply `hostDirectives` to your component, the inputs and outputs from the host directives
are not included in your component's API by default. You can explicitly include inputs and outputs
in your component's API by expanding the entry in `hostDirectives`:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'admin-menu',
  template: 'admin-menu.html',
  hostDirectives: [{
    directive: MenuBehavior,
    inputs: ['menuId'],
    outputs: ['menuClosed'],
  }],
})
export class AdminMenu { }
```

By explicitly specifying the inputs and outputs, consumers of the component with `hostDirective` can
bind them in a template:

```angular-html

<admin-menu menuId="top-menu" (menuClosed)="logMenuClosed()">
```

Furthermore, you can alias inputs and outputs from `hostDirective` to customize the API of your
component:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'admin-menu',
  template: 'admin-menu.html',
  hostDirectives: [{
    directive: MenuBehavior,
    inputs: ['menuId: id'],
    outputs: ['menuClosed: closed'],
  }],
})
export class AdminMenu { }
```

```angular-html

<admin-menu id="top-menu" (closed)="logMenuClosed()">
```

## Adding directives to another directive

You can also add `hostDirectives` to other directives, in addition to components. This enables the
transitive aggregation of multiple behaviors.

In the following example, we define two directives, `Menu` and `Tooltip`. We then compose the behavior
of these two directives in `MenuWithTooltip`. Finally, we apply `MenuWithTooltip`
to `SpecializedMenuWithTooltip`.

When `SpecializedMenuWithTooltip` is used in a template, it creates instances of all of `Menu`
, `Tooltip`, and `MenuWithTooltip`. Each of these directives' host bindings apply to the host
element of `SpecializedMenuWithTooltip`.

```typescript
@Directive({...})
export class Menu { }

@Directive({...})
export class Tooltip { }

// MenuWithTooltip can compose behaviors from multiple other directives
@Directive({
  hostDirectives: [Tooltip, Menu],
})
export class MenuWithTooltip { }

// CustomWidget can apply the already-composed behaviors from MenuWithTooltip
@Directive({
  hostDirectives: [MenuWithTooltip],
})
export class SpecializedMenuWithTooltip { }
```

## Host directive semantics

### Directive execution order

Host directives go through the same lifecycle as components and directives used directly in a
template. However, host directives always execute their constructor, lifecycle hooks, and bindings _before_ the component or directive on which they are applied.

The following example shows minimal use of a host directive:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'admin-menu',
  template: 'admin-menu.html',
  hostDirectives: [MenuBehavior],
})
export class AdminMenu { }
```

The order of execution here is:

1. `MenuBehavior` instantiated
2. `AdminMenu` instantiated
3. `MenuBehavior` receives inputs (`ngOnInit`)
4. `AdminMenu` receives inputs (`ngOnInit`)
5. `MenuBehavior` applies host bindings
6. `AdminMenu` applies host bindings

This order of operations means that components with `hostDirectives` can override any host bindings
specified by a host directive.

This order of operations extends to nested chains of host directives, as shown in the following
example.

```typescript
@Directive({...})
export class Tooltip { }

@Directive({
  hostDirectives: [Tooltip],
})
export class CustomTooltip { }

@Directive({
  hostDirectives: [CustomTooltip],
})
export class EvenMoreCustomTooltip { }
```

In the example above, the order of execution is:

1. `Tooltip` instantiated
2. `CustomTooltip` instantiated
3. `EvenMoreCustomTooltip` instantiated
4. `Tooltip` receives inputs (`ngOnInit`)
5. `CustomTooltip` receives inputs (`ngOnInit`)
6. `EvenMoreCustomTooltip` receives inputs (`ngOnInit`)
7. `Tooltip` applies host bindings
8. `CustomTooltip` applies host bindings
9. `EvenMoreCustomTooltip` applies host bindings

### Dependency injection

A component or directive that specifies `hostDirectives` can inject the instances of those host
directives and vice versa.

When applying host directives to a component, both the component and host directives can define
providers.

If a component or directive with `hostDirectives` and those host directives both provide the same
injection token, the providers defined by class with `hostDirectives` take precedence over providers
defined by the host directives.

<docs-decorative-header title="Built-in directives" imgSrc="adev/src/assets/images/directives.svg"> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.
</docs-decorative-header>

Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

The different types of Angular directives are as follows:

| Directive Types                                          | Details                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Components](guide/components)                           | Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.   |
| [Attribute directives](#built-in-attribute-directives)   | Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. |
| [Structural directives](#built-in-structural-directives) | Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.                        |

This guide covers built-in [attribute directives](#built-in-attribute-directives) and [structural directives](#built-in-structural-directives).

## Built-in attribute directives

Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.

The most common attribute directives are as follows:

| Common directives                                             | Details                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| [`NgClass`](#adding-and-removing-classes-with-ngclass)        | Adds and removes a set of CSS classes.             |
| [`NgStyle`](#setting-inline-styles-with-ngstyle)              | Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.             |
| [`NgModel`](#displaying-and-updating-properties-with-ngmodel) | Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element. |

HELPFUL: Built-in directives use only public APIs. They do not have special access to any private APIs that other directives can't access.

## Adding and removing classes with `NgClass`

Add or remove multiple CSS classes simultaneously with `ngClass`.

HELPFUL: To add or remove a _single_ class, use [class binding](guide/templates/class-binding) rather than `NgClass`.

### Import `NgClass` in the component

To use `NgClass`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgClass import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-class"/>

### Using `NgClass` with an expression

On the element you'd like to style, add `[ngClass]` and set it equal to an expression.
In this case, `isSpecial` is a boolean set to `true` in `app.component.ts`.
Because `isSpecial` is true, `ngClass` applies the class of `special` to the `<div>`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="special-div"/>

### Using `NgClass` with a method

1. To use `NgClass` with a method, add the method to the component class.
   In the following example, `setCurrentClasses()` sets the property `currentClasses` with an object that adds or removes three classes based on the `true` or `false` state of three other component properties.

   Each key of the object is a CSS class name.
   If a key is `true`, `ngClass` adds the class.
   If a key is `false`, `ngClass` removes the class.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="setClasses"/>

1. In the template, add the `ngClass` property binding to `currentClasses` to set the element's classes:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgClass-1"/>

For this use case, Angular applies the classes on initialization and in case of changes caused by reassigning the `currentClasses` object.
The full example calls `setCurrentClasses()` initially with `ngOnInit()` when the user clicks on the `Refresh currentClasses` button.
These steps are not necessary to implement `ngClass`.

## Setting inline styles with `NgStyle`

HELPFUL: To add or remove a _single_ style, use [style bindings](guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings) rather than `NgStyle`.

### Import `NgStyle` in the component

To use `NgStyle`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgStyle import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-style"/>

Use `NgStyle` to set multiple inline styles simultaneously, based on the state of the component.

1. To use `NgStyle`, add a method to the component class.

   In the following example, `setCurrentStyles()` sets the property `currentStyles` with an object that defines three styles, based on the state of three other component properties.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="setStyles"/>

1. To set the element's styles, add an `ngStyle` property binding to `currentStyles`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgStyle-2"/>

For this use case, Angular applies the styles upon initialization and in case of changes.
To do this, the full example calls `setCurrentStyles()` initially with `ngOnInit()` and when the dependent properties change through a button click.
However, these steps are not necessary to implement `ngStyle` on its own.

## Displaying and updating properties with `ngModel`

Use the `NgModel` directive to display a data property and update that property when the user makes changes.

1. Import `FormsModule` and add it to the AppComponent's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (FormsModule import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-forms-module" />

1. Add an `[(ngModel)]` binding on an HTML `<form>` element and set it equal to the property, here `name`.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (NgModel example)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgModel-1"/>

   This `[(ngModel)]` syntax can only set a data-bound property.

To customize your configuration, write the expanded form, which separates the property and event binding.
Use [property binding](guide/templates/property-binding) to set the property and [event binding](guide/templates/event-listeners) to respond to changes.
The following example changes the `<input>` value to uppercase:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="uppercase"/>

Here are all variations in action, including the uppercase version:

<img alt="NgModel variations" src="assets/images/guide/built-in-directives/ng-model-anim.gif">

### `NgModel` and value accessors

The `NgModel` directive works for an element supported by a [ControlValueAccessor](api/forms/ControlValueAccessor).
Angular provides _value accessors_ for all of the basic HTML form elements.
For more information, see [Forms](guide/forms).

To apply `[(ngModel)]` to a non-form built-in element or a third-party custom component, you have to write a value accessor.
For more information, see the API documentation on [DefaultValueAccessor](api/forms/DefaultValueAccessor).

HELPFUL: When you write an Angular component, you don't need a value accessor or `NgModel` if you name the value and event properties according to Angular's [two-way binding syntax](guide/templates/two-way-binding#how-two-way-binding-works).

## Built-in structural directives

Structural directives are responsible for HTML layout.
They shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the host elements to which they are attached.

This section introduces the most common built-in structural directives:

| Common built-in structural directives              | Details                                                          |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`NgIf`](#adding-or-removing-an-element-with-ngif) | Conditionally creates or disposes of subviews from the template. |
| [`NgFor`](#listing-items-with-ngfor)               | Repeat a node for each item in a list.                           |
| [`NgSwitch`](#switching-cases-with-ngswitch)       | A set of directives that switch among alternative views.         |

For more information, see [Structural Directives](guide/directives/structural-directives).

## Adding or removing an element with `NgIf`

Add or remove an element by applying an `NgIf` directive to a host element.

When `NgIf` is `false`, Angular removes an element and its descendants from the DOM.
Angular then disposes of their components, which frees up memory and resources.

### Import `NgIf` in the component

To use `NgIf`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgIf import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-if"/>

### Using `NgIf`

To add or remove an element, bind `*ngIf` to a condition expression such as `isActive` in the following example.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgIf-1"/>

When the `isActive` expression returns a truthy value, `NgIf` adds the `ItemDetailComponent` to the DOM.
When the expression is falsy, `NgIf` removes the `ItemDetailComponent` from the DOM and disposes of the component and all of its subcomponents.

For more information on `NgIf` and `NgIfElse`, see the [NgIf API documentation](api/common/NgIf).

### Guarding against `null`

By default, `NgIf` prevents display of an element bound to a null value.

To use `NgIf` to guard a `<div>`, add `*ngIf="yourProperty"` to the `<div>`.
In the following example, the `currentCustomer` name appears because there is a `currentCustomer`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgIf-2"/>

However, if the property is `null`, Angular does not display the `<div>`.
In this example, Angular does not display the `nullCustomer` because it is `null`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgIf-2b"/>

## Listing items with `NgFor`

Use the `NgFor` directive to present a list of items.

### Import `NgFor` in the component

To use `NgFor`, add it to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgFor import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-for"/>

### Using `NgFor`

To use `NgFor`, you have to:

1. Define a block of HTML that determines how Angular renders a single item.
1. To list your items, assign the shorthand `let item of items` to `*ngFor`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgFor-1"/>

The string `"let item of items"` instructs Angular to do the following:

- Store each item in the `items` array in the local `item` looping variable
- Make each item available to the templated HTML for each iteration
- Translate `"let item of items"` into an `<ng-template>` around the host element
- Repeat the `<ng-template>` for each `item` in the list

For more information see the [Structural directive shorthand](guide/directives/structural-directives#structural-directive-shorthand) section of [Structural directives](guide/directives/structural-directives).

### Repeating a component view

To repeat a component element, apply `*ngFor` to the selector.
In the following example, the selector is `<app-item-detail>`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgFor-2"/>

Reference a template input variable, such as `item`, in the following locations:

- Within the `ngFor` host element
- Within the host element descendants to access the item's properties

The following example references `item` first in an interpolation and then passes in a binding to the `item` property of the `<app-item-detail>` component.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgFor-1-2"/>

For more information about template input variables, see [Structural directive shorthand](guide/directives/structural-directives#structural-directive-shorthand).

### Getting the `index` of `*ngFor`

Get the `index` of `*ngFor` in a template input variable and use it in the template.

In the `*ngFor`, add a semicolon and `let i=index` to the shorthand.
The following example gets the `index` in a variable named `i` and displays it with the item name.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgFor-3"/>

The index property of the `NgFor` directive context returns the zero-based index of the item in each iteration.

Angular translates this instruction into an `<ng-template>` around the host element,
then uses this template repeatedly to create a new set of elements and bindings for each `item`
in the list.
For more information about shorthand, see the [Structural Directives](guide/directives/structural-directives#structural-directive-shorthand) guide.

## Repeating elements when a condition is true

To repeat a block of HTML when a particular condition is true, put the `*ngIf` on a container element that wraps an `*ngFor` element.

For more information see [one structural directive per element](guide/directives/structural-directives#one-structural-directive-per-element).

### Tracking items with `*ngFor` `trackBy`

Reduce the number of calls your application makes to the server by tracking changes to an item list.
With the `*ngFor` `trackBy` property, Angular can change and re-render only those items that have changed, rather than reloading the entire list of items.

1. Add a method to the component that returns the value `NgFor` should track.
In this example, the value to track is the item's `id`.
If the browser has already rendered `id`, Angular keeps track of it and doesn't re-query the server for the same `id`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="trackByItems"/>

1. In the shorthand expression, set `trackBy` to the `trackByItems()` method.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="trackBy"/>

**Change ids** creates new items with new `item.id`s.
In the following illustration of the `trackBy` effect, **Reset items** creates new items with the same `item.id`s.

- With no `trackBy`, both buttons trigger complete DOM element replacement.
- With `trackBy`, only changing the `id` triggers element replacement.

<img alt="Animation of trackBy" src="assets/images/guide/built-in-directives/ngfor-trackby.gif">

## Hosting a directive without a DOM element

The Angular `<ng-container>` is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.

Use `<ng-container>` when there's no single element to host the directive.

Here's a conditional paragraph using `<ng-container>`.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (ngif-ngcontainer)" path="adev/src/content/examples/structural-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="ngif-ngcontainer"/>

<img alt="ngcontainer paragraph with proper style" src="assets/images/guide/structural-directives/good-paragraph.png">

1. Import the `ngModel` directive from `FormsModule`.

1. Add `FormsModule` to the imports section of the relevant Angular module.

1. To conditionally exclude an `<option>`, wrap the `<option>` in an `<ng-container>`.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (select-ngcontainer)" path="adev/src/content/examples/structural-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="select-ngcontainer"/>

   <img alt="ngcontainer options work properly" src="assets/images/guide/structural-directives/select-ngcontainer-anim.gif">

## Switching cases with `NgSwitch`

Like the JavaScript `switch` statement, `NgSwitch` displays one element from among several possible elements, based on a switch condition.
Angular puts only the selected element into the DOM.

<!--todo: API Flagged -->

`NgSwitch` is a set of three directives:

| `NgSwitch` directives | Details                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NgSwitch`            | An attribute directive that changes the behavior of its companion directives.                                                                                          |
| `NgSwitchCase`        | Structural directive that adds its element to the DOM when its bound value equals the switch value and removes its bound value when it doesn't equal the switch value. |
| `NgSwitchDefault`     | Structural directive that adds its element to the DOM when there is no selected `NgSwitchCase`.                                                                        |

To use the directives, add the `NgSwitch`, `NgSwitchCase` and `NgSwitchDefault` to the component's `imports` list.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts (NgSwitch imports)" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-ng-switch"/>

### Using `NgSwitch`

1. On an element, such as a `<div>`, add `[ngSwitch]` bound to an expression that returns the switch value, such as `feature`.
   Though the `feature` value in this example is a string, the switch value can be of any type.

1. Bind to `*ngSwitchCase` and `*ngSwitchDefault` on the elements for the cases.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgSwitch"/>

1. In the parent component, define `currentItem`, to use it in the `[ngSwitch]` expression.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleRegion="item"/>

1. In each child component, add an `item` [input property](guide/components/inputs) which is bound to the `currentItem` of the parent component.
   The following two snippets show the parent component and one of the child components.
   The other child components are identical to `StoutItemComponent`.

   <docs-code header="In each child component, here StoutItemComponent" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/item-switch.component.ts" visibleRegion="input"/>

   <img alt="Animation of NgSwitch" src="assets/images/guide/built-in-directives/ngswitch.gif">

Switch directives also work with built-in HTML elements and web components.
For example, you could replace the `<app-best-item>` switch case with a `<div>` as follows.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/built-in-directives/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="NgSwitch-div"/>

================================================
# Structural directives

Structural directives are directives applied to an `<ng-template>` element that conditionally or repeatedly render the content of that `<ng-template>`.

## Example use case

In this guide you'll build a structural directive which fetches data from a given data source and renders its template when that data is available. This directive is called `SelectDirective`, after the SQL keyword `SELECT`, and match it with an attribute selector `[select]`.

`SelectDirective` will have an input naming the data source to be used, which you will call `selectFrom`. The `select` prefix for this input is important for the [shorthand syntax](#structural-directive-shorthand). The directive will instantiate its `<ng-template>` with a template context providing the selected data.

The following is an example of using this directive directly on an `<ng-template>` would look like:

```angular-html
<ng-template select let-data [selectFrom]="source">
  <p>The data is: {{ data }}</p>
</ng-template>
```

The structural directive can wait for the data to become available and then render its `<ng-template>`.

HELPFUL: Note that Angular's `<ng-template>` element defines a template that doesn't render anything by default, if you just wrap elements in an `<ng-template>` without applying a structural directive those elements will not be rendered.

For more information, see the [ng-template API](api/core/ng-template) documentation.

## Structural directive shorthand

Angular supports a shorthand syntax for structural directives which avoids the need to explicitly author an `<ng-template>` element.

Structural directives can be applied directly on an element by prefixing the directive attribute selector with an asterisk (`*`), such as `*select`. Angular transforms the asterisk in front of a structural directive into an `<ng-template>` that hosts the directive and surrounds the element and its descendants.

You can use this with `SelectDirective` as follows:

```angular-html
<p *select="let data from source">The data is: {{data}}</p>
```

This example shows the flexibility of structural directive shorthand syntax, which is sometimes called _microsyntax_.

When used in this way, only the structural directive and its bindings are applied to the `<ng-template>`. Any other attributes or bindings on the `<p>` tag are left alone. For example, these two forms are equivalent:

```angular-html
<!-- Shorthand syntax: -->
<p class="data-view" *select="let data from source">The data is: {{data}}</p>

<!-- Long-form syntax: -->
<ng-template select let-data [selectFrom]="source">
  <p class="data-view">The data is: {{data}}</p>
</ng-template>
```

Shorthand syntax is expanded through a set of conventions. A more thorough [grammar](#structural-directive-syntax-reference) is defined below, but in the above example, this transformation can be explained as follows:

The first part of the `*select` expression is `let data`, which declares a template variable `data`. Since no assignment follows, the template variable is bound to the template context property `$implicit`.

The second piece of syntax is a key-expression pair, `from source`. `from` is a binding key and `source` is a regular template expression. Binding keys are mapped to properties by transforming them to PascalCase and prepending the structural directive selector. The `from` key is mapped to `selectFrom`, which is then bound to the expression `source`. This is why many structural directives will have inputs that are all prefixed with the structural directive's selector.

## One structural directive per element

You can only apply one structural directive per element when using the shorthand syntax. This is because there is only one `<ng-template>` element onto which that directive gets unwrapped. Multiple directives would require multiple nested `<ng-template>`, and it's unclear which directive should be first. `<ng-container>` can be used when to create wrapper layers when multiple structural directives need to be applied around the same physical DOM element or component, which allows the user to define the nested structure.

## Creating a structural directive

This section guides you through creating the `SelectDirective`.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Generate the directive">
Using the Angular CLI, run the following command, where `select` is the name of the directive:

```shell
ng generate directive select
```

Angular creates the directive class and specifies the CSS selector, `[select]`, that identifies the directive in a template.
</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Make the directive structural">
Import `TemplateRef`, and `ViewContainerRef`. Inject `TemplateRef` and `ViewContainerRef` in the directive as private properties.

```ts
import {Directive, TemplateRef, ViewContainerRef} from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[select]',
})
export class SelectDirective {
  private templateRef = inject(TemplateRef);
  private ViewContainerRef = inject(ViewContainerRef);
}

```

</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Add the 'selectFrom' input">
Add a `selectFrom` `@Input()` property.

```ts
export class SelectDirective {
  // ...

  @Input({required: true}) selectFrom!: DataSource;
}
```

</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Add the business logic">
With `SelectDirective` now scaffolded as a structural directive with its input, you can now add the logic to fetch the data and render the template with it:

```ts
export class SelectDirective {
  // ...

  async ngOnInit() {
    const data = await this.selectFrom.load();
    this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef, {
      // Create the embedded view with a context object that contains
      // the data via the key `$implicit`.
      $implicit: data,
    });
  }
}
```

</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

That's it - `SelectDirective` is up and running. A follow-up step might be to [add template type-checking support](#typing-the-directives-context).

## Structural directive syntax reference

When you write your own structural directives, use the following syntax:

<docs-code hideCopy language="typescript">

*:prefix="( :let | :expression ) (';' | ',')? ( :let | :as | :keyExp )*"

</docs-code>

The following patterns describe each portion of the structural directive grammar:

```ts
as = :export "as" :local ";"?
keyExp = :key ":"? :expression ("as" :local)? ";"?
let = "let" :local "=" :export ";"?
```

| Keyword      | Details                                            |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix`     | HTML attribute key                                 |
| `key`        | HTML attribute key                                 |
| `local`      | Local variable name used in the template           |
| `export`     | Value exported by the directive under a given name |
| `expression` | Standard Angular expression                        |

### How Angular translates shorthand

Angular translates structural directive shorthand into the normal binding syntax as follows:

| Shorthand | Translation |
|:--- |:--- |
| `prefix` and naked `expression` | `[prefix]="expression"` |
| `keyExp` | `[prefixKey]="expression"` (The `prefix` is added to the `key`) |
| `let local` | `let-local="export"` |

### Shorthand examples

The following table provides shorthand examples:

| Shorthand | How Angular interprets the syntax |
|:--- |:--- |
| `*ngFor="let item of [1,2,3]"` | `<ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="[1, 2, 3]">` |
| `*ngFor="let item of [1,2,3] as items; trackBy: myTrack; index as i"` | `<ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="[1,2,3]" let-items="ngForOf" [ngForTrackBy]="myTrack" let-i="index">` |
| `*ngIf="exp"`| `<ng-template [ngIf]="exp">` |
| `*ngIf="exp as value"` | `<ng-template [ngIf]="exp" let-value="ngIf">` |

## Improving template type checking for custom directives

You can improve template type checking for custom directives by adding template guards to your directive definition.
These guards help the Angular template type checker find mistakes in the template at compile time, which can avoid runtime errors.
Two different types of guards are possible:

* `ngTemplateGuard_(input)` lets you control how an input expression should be narrowed based on the type of a specific input.
* `ngTemplateContextGuard` is used to determine the type of the context object for the template, based on the type of the directive itself.

This section provides examples of both kinds of guards.
For more information, see [Template type checking](tools/cli/template-typecheck "Template type-checking guide").

### Type narrowing with template guards

A structural directive in a template controls whether that template is rendered at run time. Some structural directives want to perform type narrowing based on the type of input expression.

There are two narrowings which are possible with input guards:

* Narrowing the input expression based on a TypeScript type assertion function.
* Narrowing the input expression based on its truthiness.

To narrow the input expression by defining a type assertion function:

```ts
// This directive only renders its template if the actor is a user.
// You want to assert that within the template, the type of the `actor`
// expression is narrowed to `User`.
@Directive(...)
class ActorIsUser {
  @Input() actor: User|Robot;

  static ngTemplateGuard_actor(dir: ActorIsUser, expr: User|Robot): expr is User {
    // The return statement is unnecessary in practice, but included to
    // prevent TypeScript errors.
    return true;
  }
}
```

Type-checking will behave within the template as if the `ngTemplateGuard_actor` has been asserted on the expression bound to the input.

Some directives only render their templates when an input is truthy. It's not possible to capture the full semantics of truthiness in a type assertion function, so instead a literal type of `'binding'` can be used to signal to the template type-checker that the binding expression itself should be used as the guard:

```ts
@Directive(...)
class CustomIf {
  @Input() condition!: any;

  static ngTemplateGuard_condition: 'binding';
}
```

The template type-checker will behave as if the expression bound to `condition` was asserted to be truthy within the template.

### Typing the directive's context

If your structural directive provides a context to the instantiated template, you can properly type it inside the template by providing a static `ngTemplateContextGuard` type assertion function. This function can use the type of the directive to derive the type of the context, which is useful when the type of the directive is generic.

For the `SelectDirective` described above, you can implement an `ngTemplateContextGuard` to correctly specify the data type, even if the data source is generic.

```ts
// Declare an interface for the template context:
export interface SelectTemplateContext<T> {
  $implicit: T;
}

@Directive(...)
export class SelectDirective<T> {
  // The directive's generic type `T` will be inferred from the `DataSource` type
  // passed to the input.
  @Input({required: true}) selectFrom!: DataSource<T>;

  // Narrow the type of the context using the generic type of the directive.
  static ngTemplateContextGuard<T>(dir: SelectDirective<T>, ctx: any): ctx is SelectTemplateContext<T> {
    // As before the guard body is not used at runtime, and included only to avoid
    // TypeScript errors.
    return true;
  }
}
```

# Building dynamic forms

Many forms, such as questionnaires, can be very similar to one another in format and intent.
To make it faster and easier to generate different versions of such a form, you can create a _dynamic form template_ based on metadata that describes the business object model.
Then, use the template to generate new forms automatically, according to changes in the data model.

The technique is particularly useful when you have a type of form whose content must change frequently to meet rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements.
A typical use-case is a questionnaire.
You might need to get input from users in different contexts.
The format and style of the forms a user sees should remain constant, while the actual questions you need to ask vary with the context.

In this tutorial you will build a dynamic form that presents a basic questionnaire.
You build an online application for heroes seeking employment.
The agency is constantly tinkering with the application process, but by using the dynamic form
you can create the new forms on the fly without changing the application code.

The tutorial walks you through the following steps.

1. Enable reactive forms for a project.
1. Establish a data model to represent form controls.
1. Populate the model with sample data.
1. Develop a component to create form controls dynamically.

The form you create uses input validation and styling to improve the user experience.
It has a Submit button that is only enabled when all user input is valid, and flags invalid input with color coding and error messages.

The basic version can evolve to support a richer variety of questions, more graceful rendering, and superior user experience.

## Enable reactive forms for your project

Dynamic forms are based on reactive forms.

To give the application access reactive forms directives, import `ReactiveFormsModule` from the `@angular/forms` library into the necessary components.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="dynamic-form.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form.component.ts"/>
    <docs-code header="dynamic-form-question.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form-question.component.ts"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

## Create a form object model

A dynamic form requires an object model that can describe all scenarios needed by the form functionality.
The example hero-application form is a set of questions — that is, each control in the form must ask a question and accept an answer.

The data model for this type of form must represent a question.
The example includes the `DynamicFormQuestionComponent`, which defines a question as the fundamental object in the model.

The following `QuestionBase` is a base class for a set of controls that can represent the question and its answer in the form.

<docs-code header="src/app/question-base.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/question-base.ts"/>

### Define control classes

From this base, the example derives two new classes, `TextboxQuestion` and `DropdownQuestion`, that represent different control types.
When you create the form template in the next step, you instantiate these specific question types in order to render the appropriate controls dynamically.

The `TextboxQuestion` control type is represented in a form template using an `<input>` element. It presents a question and lets users enter input. The `type` attribute of the element is defined based on the `type` field specified in the `options` argument (for example `text`, `email`, `url`).

<docs-code header="question-textbox.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/question-textbox.ts"/>

The `DropdownQuestion` control type presents a list of choices in a select box.

 <docs-code header="question-dropdown.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/question-dropdown.ts"/>

### Compose form groups

A dynamic form uses a service to create grouped sets of input controls, based on the form model.
The following `QuestionControlService` collects a set of `FormGroup` instances that consume the metadata from the question model.
You can specify default values and validation rules.

<docs-code header="src/app/question-control.service.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/question-control.service.ts"/>

## Compose dynamic form contents

The dynamic form itself is represented by a container component, which you add in a later step.
Each question is represented in the form component's template by an `<app-question>` tag, which matches an instance of `DynamicFormQuestionComponent`.

The `DynamicFormQuestionComponent` is responsible for rendering the details of an individual question based on values in the data-bound question object.
The form relies on a [`[formGroup]` directive](api/forms/FormGroupDirective "API reference") to connect the template HTML to the underlying control objects.
The `DynamicFormQuestionComponent` creates form groups and populates them with controls defined in the question model, specifying display and validation rules.

<docs-code-multifile>
  <docs-code header="dynamic-form-question.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form-question.component.html"/>
  <docs-code header="dynamic-form-question.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form-question.component.ts"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

The goal of the `DynamicFormQuestionComponent` is to present question types defined in your model.
You only have two types of questions at this point but you can imagine many more.
The `ngSwitch` statement in the template determines which type of question to display.
The switch uses directives with the [`formControlName`](api/forms/FormControlName "FormControlName directive API reference") and [`formGroup`](api/forms/FormGroupDirective "FormGroupDirective API reference") selectors.
Both directives are defined in `ReactiveFormsModule`.

### Supply data

Another service is needed to supply a specific set of questions from which to build an individual form.
For this exercise you create the `QuestionService` to supply this array of questions from the hard-coded sample data.
In a real-world app, the service might fetch data from a backend system.
The key point, however, is that you control the hero job-application questions entirely through the objects returned from `QuestionService`.
To maintain the questionnaire as requirements change, you only need to add, update, and remove objects from the `questions` array.

The `QuestionService` supplies a set of questions in the form of an array bound to `@Input()` questions.

<docs-code header="src/app/question.service.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/question.service.ts"/>

## Create a dynamic form template

The `DynamicFormComponent` component is the entry point and the main container for the form, which is represented using the `<app-dynamic-form>` in a template.

The `DynamicFormComponent` component presents a list of questions by binding each one to an `<app-question>` element that matches the `DynamicFormQuestionComponent`.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="dynamic-form.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form.component.html"/>
    <docs-code header="dynamic-form.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/dynamic-form.component.ts"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

### Display the form

To display an instance of the dynamic form, the `AppComponent` shell template passes the `questions` array returned by the `QuestionService` to the form container component, `<app-dynamic-form>`.

<docs-code header="app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/dynamic-form/src/app/app.component.ts"/>

This separation of model and data lets you repurpose the components for any type of survey, as long as it's compatible with the _question_ object model.

### Ensuring valid data

The form template uses dynamic data binding of metadata to render the form without making any hardcoded assumptions about specific questions.
It adds both control metadata and validation criteria dynamically.

To ensure valid input, the _Save_ button is disabled until the form is in a valid state.
When the form is valid, click _Save_ and the application renders the current form values as JSON.

The following figure shows the final form.

# Validating form input

You can improve overall data quality by validating user input for accuracy and completeness.
This page shows how to validate user input from the UI and display useful validation messages, in both reactive and template-driven forms.

## Validating input in template-driven forms

To add validation to a template-driven form, you add the same validation attributes as you would with [native HTML form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Constraint_validation).
Angular uses directives to match these attributes with validator functions in the framework.

Every time the value of a form control changes, Angular runs validation and generates either a list of validation errors that results in an `INVALID` status, or null, which results in a VALID status.

You can then inspect the control's state by exporting `ngModel` to a local template variable.
The following example exports `NgModel` into a variable called `name`:

<docs-code header="template/actor-form-template.component.html (name)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/template/actor-form-template.component.html" visibleRegion="name-with-error-msg"/>

Notice the following features illustrated by the example.

* The `<input>` element carries the HTML validation attributes: `required` and `minlength`.
    It also carries a custom validator directive, `forbiddenName`.
    For more information, see the [Custom validators](#defining-custom-validators) section.

* `#name="ngModel"` exports `NgModel` into a local variable called `name`.
    `NgModel` mirrors many of the properties of its underlying `FormControl` instance, so you can use this in the template to check for control states such as `valid` and `dirty`.
    For a full list of control properties, see the [AbstractControl](api/forms/AbstractControl) API reference.

  * The `*ngIf` on the `<div>` element reveals a set of nested message `divs` but only if the `name` is invalid and the control is either `dirty` or `touched`.

  * Each nested `<div>` can present a custom message for one of the possible validation errors.
        There are messages for `required`, `minlength`, and `forbiddenName`.

HELPFUL: To prevent the validator from displaying errors before the user has a chance to edit the form, you should check for either the `dirty` or `touched` states in a control.

* When the user changes the value in the watched field, the control is marked as "dirty"
* When the user blurs the form control element, the control is marked as "touched"

## Validating input in reactive forms

In a reactive form, the source of truth is the component class.
Instead of adding validators through attributes in the template, you add validator functions directly to the form control model in the component class.
Angular then calls these functions whenever the value of the control changes.

### Validator functions

Validator functions can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

| Validator type   | Details |
|:---              |:---     |
| Sync validators  | Synchronous functions that take a control instance and immediately return either a set of validation errors or `null`. Pass these in as the second argument when you instantiate a `FormControl`.                       |
| Async validators | Asynchronous functions that take a control instance and return a Promise or Observable that later emits a set of validation errors or `null`. Pass these in as the third argument when you instantiate a `FormControl`. |

For performance reasons, Angular only runs async validators if all sync validators pass.
Each must complete before errors are set.

### Built-in validator functions

You can choose to [write your own validator functions](#defining-custom-validators), or you can use some of Angular's built-in validators.

The same built-in validators that are available as attributes in template-driven forms, such as `required` and `minlength`, are all available to use as functions from the `Validators` class.
For a full list of built-in validators, see the [Validators](api/forms/Validators) API reference.

To update the actor form to be a reactive form, use some of the same
built-in validators —this time, in function form, as in the following example.

<docs-code header="reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.ts (validator functions)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="form-group"/>

In this example, the `name` control sets up two built-in validators —`Validators.required` and `Validators.minLength(4)`— and one custom validator, `forbiddenNameValidator`.

All of these validators are synchronous, so they are passed as the second argument.
Notice that you can support multiple validators by passing the functions in as an array.

This example also adds a few getter methods.
In a reactive form, you can always access any form control through the `get` method on its parent group, but sometimes it's useful to define getters as shorthand for the template.

If you look at the template for the `name` input again, it is fairly similar to the template-driven example.

<docs-code header="reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.html (name with error msg)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.html" visibleRegion="name-with-error-msg"/>

This form differs from the template-driven version in that it no longer exports any directives. Instead, it uses the `name` getter defined in  the component class.

Notice that the `required` attribute is still present in the template. Although it's not necessary for validation, it should be retained for accessibility purposes.

## Defining custom validators

The built-in validators don't always match the exact use case of your application, so you sometimes need to create a custom validator.

Consider the `forbiddenNameValidator` function from the previous example.
Here's what the definition of that function looks like.

<docs-code header="shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts (forbiddenNameValidator)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts" visibleRegion="custom-validator"/>

The function is a factory that takes a regular expression to detect a *specific* forbidden name and returns a validator function.

In this sample, the forbidden name is "bob", so the validator rejects any actor name containing "bob".
Elsewhere it could reject "alice" or any name that the configuring regular expression matches.

The `forbiddenNameValidator` factory returns the configured validator function.
That function takes an Angular control object and returns *either* null if the control value is valid *or* a validation error object.
The validation error object typically has a property whose name is the validation key, `'forbiddenName'`, and whose value is an arbitrary dictionary of values that you could insert into an error message, `{name}`.

Custom async validators are similar to sync validators, but they must instead return a Promise or observable that later emits null or a validation error object.
In the case of an observable, the observable must complete, at which point the form uses the last value emitted for validation.

### Adding custom validators to reactive forms

In reactive forms, add a custom validator by passing the function directly to the `FormControl`.

<docs-code header="reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.ts (validator functions)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="custom-validator"/>

### Adding custom validators to template-driven forms

In template-driven forms, add a directive to the template, where the directive wraps the validator function.
For example, the corresponding `ForbiddenValidatorDirective` serves as a wrapper around the `forbiddenNameValidator`.

Angular recognizes the directive's role in the validation process because the directive registers itself with the `NG_VALIDATORS` provider, as shown in the following example.
`NG_VALIDATORS` is a predefined provider with an extensible collection of validators.

<docs-code header="shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts (providers)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts" visibleRegion="directive-providers"/>

The directive class then implements the `Validator` interface, so that it can easily integrate with Angular forms.
Here is the rest of the directive to help you get an idea of how it all comes together.

<docs-code header="shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts (directive)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/forbidden-name.directive.ts" visibleRegion="directive"/>

Once the `ForbiddenValidatorDirective` is ready, you can add its selector, `appForbiddenName`, to any input element to activate it.
For example:

<docs-code header="template/actor-form-template.component.html (forbidden-name-input)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/template/actor-form-template.component.html" visibleRegion="name-input"/>

HELPFUL: Notice that the custom validation directive is instantiated with `useExisting` rather than `useClass`.
The registered validator must be *this instance* of the `ForbiddenValidatorDirective` —the instance in the form with its `forbiddenName` property bound to "bob".

If you were to replace `useExisting` with `useClass`, then you'd be registering a new class instance, one that doesn't have a `forbiddenName`.

## Control status CSS classes

Angular automatically mirrors many control properties onto the form control element as CSS classes.
Use these classes to style form control elements according to the state of the form.
The following classes are currently supported.

* `.ng-valid`
* `.ng-invalid`
* `.ng-pending`
* `.ng-pristine`
* `.ng-dirty`
* `.ng-untouched`
* `.ng-touched`
* `.ng-submitted` \(enclosing form element only\)

In the following example, the actor form uses the `.ng-valid` and `.ng-invalid` classes to
set the color of each form control's border.

<docs-code header="forms.css (status classes)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/assets/forms.css"/>

## Cross-field validation

A cross-field validator is a [custom validator](#defining-custom-validators "Read about custom validators") that compares the values of different fields in a form and accepts or rejects them in combination.
For example, you might have a form that offers mutually incompatible options, so that if the user can choose A or B, but not both.
Some field values might also depend on others; a user might be allowed to choose B only if A is also chosen.

The following cross validation examples show how to do the following:

* Validate reactive or template-based form input based on the values of two sibling controls,
* Show a descriptive error message after the user interacted with the form and the validation failed.

The examples use cross-validation to ensure that actors do not reuse the same name in their role by filling out the Actor Form.
The validators do this by checking that the actor names and roles do not match.

### Adding cross-validation to reactive forms

The form has the following structure:

<docs-code language="javascript">

const actorForm = new FormGroup({
  'name': new FormControl(),
  'role': new FormControl(),
  'skill': new FormControl()
});

</docs-code>

Notice that the `name` and `role` are sibling controls.
To evaluate both controls in a single custom validator, you must perform the validation in a common ancestor control: the `FormGroup`.
You query the `FormGroup` for its child controls so that you can compare their values.

To add a validator to the `FormGroup`, pass the new validator in as the second argument on creation.

<docs-code language="javascript">

const actorForm = new FormGroup({
  'name': new FormControl(),
  'role': new FormControl(),
  'skill': new FormControl()
}, { validators: unambiguousRoleValidator });

</docs-code>

The validator code is as follows.

<docs-code header="shared/unambiguous-role.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/unambiguous-role.directive.ts" visibleRegion="cross-validation-validator"/>

The `unambiguousRoleValidator` validator implements the `ValidatorFn` interface.
It takes an Angular control object as an argument and returns either null if the form is valid, or `ValidationErrors` otherwise.

The validator retrieves the child controls by calling the `FormGroup`'s [get](api/forms/AbstractControl#get) method, then compares the values of the `name` and `role` controls.

If the values do not match, the role is unambiguous, both are valid, and the validator returns null.
If they do match, the actor's role is ambiguous and the validator must mark the form as invalid by returning an error object.

To provide better user experience, the template shows an appropriate error message when the form is invalid.

<docs-code header="reactive/actor-form-template.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.html" visibleRegion="cross-validation-error-message"/>

This `*ngIf` displays the error if the `FormGroup` has the cross validation error returned by the `unambiguousRoleValidator` validator, but only if the user finished [interacting with the form](#control-status-css-classes).

### Adding cross-validation to template-driven forms

For a template-driven form, you must create a directive to wrap the validator function.
You provide that directive as the validator using the [`NG_VALIDATORS` token](/api/forms/NG_VALIDATORS), as shown in the following example.

<docs-code header="shared/unambiguous-role.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/unambiguous-role.directive.ts" visibleRegion="cross-validation-directive"/>

You must add the new directive to the HTML template.
Because the validator must be registered at the highest level in the form, the following template puts the directive on the `form` tag.

<docs-code header="template/actor-form-template.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/template/actor-form-template.component.html" visibleRegion="cross-validation-register-validator"/>

To provide better user experience, an appropriate error message appears when the form is invalid.

<docs-code header="template/actor-form-template.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/template/actor-form-template.component.html" visibleRegion="cross-validation-error-message"/>

This is the same in both template-driven and reactive forms.

## Creating asynchronous validators

Asynchronous validators implement the `AsyncValidatorFn` and `AsyncValidator` interfaces.
These are very similar to their synchronous counterparts, with the following differences.

* The `validate()` functions must return a Promise or an observable,
* The observable returned must be finite, meaning it must complete at some point.
    To convert an infinite observable into a finite one, pipe the observable through a filtering operator such as `first`, `last`, `take`, or `takeUntil`.

Asynchronous validation happens after the synchronous validation, and is performed only if the synchronous validation is successful.
This check lets forms avoid potentially expensive async validation processes \(such as an HTTP request\) if the more basic validation methods have already found invalid input.

After asynchronous validation begins, the form control enters a `pending` state.
Inspect the control's `pending` property and use it to give visual feedback about the ongoing validation operation.

A common UI pattern is to show a spinner while the async validation is being performed.
The following example shows how to achieve this in a template-driven form.

<docs-code language="html">

<input [(ngModel)]="name" #model="ngModel" appSomeAsyncValidator>
<app-spinner *ngIf="model.pending"></app-spinner>

</docs-code>

### Implementing a custom async validator

In the following example, an async validator ensures that actors are cast for a role that is not already taken.
New actors are constantly auditioning and old actors are retiring, so the list of available roles cannot be retrieved ahead of time.
To validate the potential role entry, the validator must initiate an asynchronous operation to consult a central database of all currently cast actors.

The following code creates the validator class, `UniqueRoleValidator`, which implements the `AsyncValidator` interface.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/role.directive.ts" visibleRegion="async-validator"/>

The `actorsService` property is initialized with an instace of the `ActorsService` token, which defines the following interface.

<docs-code language="typescript">
interface ActorsService {
  isRoleTaken: (role: string) => Observable<boolean>;
}
</docs-code>

In a real world application, the `ActorsService` would be responsible for making an HTTP request to the actor database to check if the role is available.
From the validator's point of view, the actual implementation of the service is not important, so the example can just code against the `ActorsService` interface.

As the validation begins, the `UnambiguousRoleValidator` delegates to the `ActorsService` `isRoleTaken()` method with the current control value.
At this point the control is marked as `pending` and remains in this state until the observable chain returned from the `validate()` method completes.

The `isRoleTaken()` method dispatches an HTTP request that checks if the role is available, and returns `Observable<boolean>` as the result.
The `validate()` method pipes the response through the `map` operator and transforms it into a validation result.

The method then, like any validator, returns `null` if the form is valid, and `ValidationErrors` if it is not.
This validator handles any potential errors with the `catchError` operator.
In this case, the validator treats the `isRoleTaken()` error as a successful validation, because failure to make a validation request does not necessarily mean that the role is invalid.
You could handle the error differently and return the `ValidationError` object instead.

After some time passes, the observable chain completes and the asynchronous validation is done.
The `pending` flag is set to `false`, and the form validity is updated.

### Adding async validators to reactive forms

To use an async validator in reactive forms, begin by injecting the validator into a property of the component class.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="async-validator-inject"/>

Then, pass the validator function directly to the `FormControl` to apply it.

In the following example, the `validate` function of `UnambiguousRoleValidator` is applied to `roleControl` by passing it to the control's `asyncValidators` option and binding it to the instance of `UnambiguousRoleValidator` that was injected into `ActorFormReactiveComponent`.
The value of `asyncValidators` can be either a single async validator function, or an array of functions.
To learn more about `FormControl` options, see the [AbstractControlOptions](api/forms/AbstractControlOptions) API reference.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/reactive/actor-form-reactive.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="async-validator-usage"/>

### Adding async validators to template-driven forms

To use an async validator in template-driven forms, create a new directive and register the `NG_ASYNC_VALIDATORS` provider on it.

In the example below, the directive injects the `UniqueRoleValidator` class that contains the actual validation logic and invokes it in the `validate` function, triggered by Angular when validation should happen.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/shared/role.directive.ts" visibleRegion="async-validator-directive"/>

Then, as with synchronous validators, add the directive's selector to an input to activate it.

<docs-code header="template/actor-form-template.component.html (unique-unambiguous-role-input)" path="adev/src/content/examples/form-validation/src/app/template/actor-form-template.component.html" visibleRegion="role-input"/>

### Optimizing performance of async validators

By default, all validators run after every form value change.
With synchronous validators, this does not normally have a noticeable impact on application performance.
Async validators, however, commonly perform some kind of HTTP request to validate the control.
Dispatching an HTTP request after every keystroke could put a strain on the backend API, and should be avoided if possible.

You can delay updating the form validity by changing the `updateOn` property from `change` (default) to `submit` or `blur`.

With template-driven forms, set the property in the template.

<docs-code language="html">
<input [(ngModel)]="name" [ngModelOptions]="{updateOn: 'blur'}">
</docs-code>

With reactive forms, set the property in the `FormControl` instance.

<docs-code language="typescript">
new FormControl('', {updateOn: 'blur'});
</docs-code>

## Interaction with native HTML form validation

By default, Angular disables [native HTML form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation) by adding the `novalidate` attribute on the enclosing `<form>` and uses directives to match these attributes with validator functions in the framework.
If you want to use native validation **in combination** with Angular-based validation, you can re-enable it with the `ngNativeValidate` directive.
See the [API docs](api/forms/NgForm#native-dom-validation-ui) for details.

================================================
<docs-decorative-header title="Forms in Angular" imgSrc="adev/src/assets/images/overview.svg"> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
Handling user input with forms is the cornerstone of many common applications.
</docs-decorative-header>

Applications use forms to enable users to log in, to update a profile, to enter sensitive information, and to perform many other data-entry tasks.

Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: reactive and template-driven.
Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.

This guide provides information to help you decide which type of form works best for your situation.
It introduces the common building blocks used by both approaches.
It also summarizes the key differences between the two approaches, and demonstrates those differences in the context of setup, data flow, and testing.

## Choosing an approach

Reactive forms and template-driven forms process and manage form data differently.
Each approach offers different advantages.

| Forms                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reactive forms        | Provide direct, explicit access to the underlying form's object model. Compared to template-driven forms, they are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.                                                                                            |
| Template-driven forms | Rely on directives in the template to create and manipulate the underlying object model. They are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. They're straightforward to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, template-driven forms could be a good fit. |

### Key differences

The following table summarizes the key differences between reactive and template-driven forms.

|                                                   | Reactive                             | Template-driven                 |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| [Setup of form model](#setting-up-the-form-model) | Explicit, created in component class | Implicit, created by directives |
| [Data model](#mutability-of-the-data-model)       | Structured and immutable             | Unstructured and mutable        |
| [Data flow](#data-flow-in-forms)                  | Synchronous                          | Asynchronous                    |
| [Form validation](#form-validation)               | Functions                            | Directives                      |

### Scalability

If forms are a central part of your application, scalability is very important.
Being able to reuse form models across components is critical.

Reactive forms are more scalable than template-driven forms.
They provide direct access to the underlying form API, and use [synchronous data flow](#data-flow-in-reactive-forms) between the view and the data model, which makes creating large-scale forms easier.
Reactive forms require less setup for testing, and testing does not require deep understanding of change detection to properly test form updates and validation.

Template-driven forms focus on simple scenarios and are not as reusable.
They abstract away the underlying form API, and use [asynchronous data flow](#data-flow-in-template-driven-forms) between the view and the data model.
The abstraction of template-driven forms also affects testing.
Tests are deeply reliant on manual change detection execution to run properly, and require more setup.

## Setting up the form model

Both reactive and template-driven forms track value changes between the form input elements that users interact with and the form data in your component model.
The two approaches share underlying building blocks, but differ in how you create and manage the common form-control instances.

### Common form foundation classes

Both reactive and template-driven forms are built on the following base classes.

| Base classes           | Details                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FormControl`          | Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.               |
| `FormGroup`            | Tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.                |
| `FormArray`            | Tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.                    |
| `ControlValueAccessor` | Creates a bridge between Angular `FormControl` instances and built-in DOM elements. |

### Setup in reactive forms

With reactive forms, you define the form model directly in the component class.
The `[formControl]` directive links the explicitly created `FormControl` instance to a specific form element in the view, using an internal value accessor.

The following component implements an input field for a single control, using reactive forms.
In this example, the form model is the `FormControl` instance.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/reactive/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.ts"/>

IMPORTANT: In reactive forms, the form model is the source of truth; it provides the value and status of the form element at any given point in time, through the `[formControl]` directive on the `<input>` element.

### Setup in template-driven forms

In template-driven forms, the form model is implicit, rather than explicit.
The directive `NgModel` creates and manages a `FormControl` instance for a given form element.

The following component implements the same input field for a single control, using template-driven forms.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/template/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.ts"/>

IMPORTANT: In a template-driven form the source of truth is the template. The `NgModel` directive automatically manages the `FormControl` instance for you.

## Data flow in forms

When an application contains a form, Angular must keep the view in sync with the component model and the component model in sync with the view.
As users change values and make selections through the view, the new values must be reflected in the data model.
Similarly, when the program logic changes values in the data model, those values must be reflected in the view.

Reactive and template-driven forms differ in how they handle data flowing from the user or from programmatic changes.
The following diagrams illustrate both kinds of data flow for each type of form, using the favorite-color input field defined above.

### Data flow in reactive forms

In reactive forms each form element in the view is directly linked to the form model (a `FormControl` instance).
Updates from the view to the model and from the model to the view are synchronous and do not depend on how the UI is rendered.

The view-to-model diagram shows how data flows when an input field's value is changed from the view through the following steps.

1. The user types a value into the input element, in this case the favorite color _Blue_.
1. The form input element emits an "input" event with the latest value.
1. The `ControlValueAccessor` listening for events on the form input element immediately relays the new value to the `FormControl` instance.
1. The `FormControl` instance emits the new value through the `valueChanges` observable.
1. Any subscribers to the `valueChanges` observable receive the new value.

```

The model-to-view diagram shows how a programmatic change to the model is propagated to the view through the following steps.

1. The user calls the `favoriteColorControl.setValue()` method, which updates the `FormControl` value.
1. The `FormControl` instance emits the new value through the `valueChanges` observable.
1. Any subscribers to the `valueChanges` observable receive the new value.
1. The control value accessor on the form input element updates the element with the new value.

### Data flow in template-driven forms

In template-driven forms, each form element is linked to a directive that manages the form model internally.

The view-to-model diagram shows how data flows when an input field's value is changed from the view through the following steps.

1. The user types _Blue_ into the input element.
1. The input element emits an "input" event with the value _Blue_.
1. The control value accessor attached to the input triggers the `setValue()` method on the `FormControl` instance.
1. The `FormControl` instance emits the new value through the `valueChanges` observable.
1. Any subscribers to the `valueChanges` observable receive the new value.
1. The control value accessor also calls the `NgModel.viewToModelUpdate()` method which emits an `ngModelChange` event.
1. Because the component template uses two-way data binding for the `favoriteColor` property, the `favoriteColor` property in the component is updated to the value emitted by the `ngModelChange` event \(_Blue_\).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    U{User}
    I("&lt;input&gt;")
    CVA(ControlValueAccessor)
    FC(FormControl)
    M(NgModel)
    O(Observers)
    C(Component)
    P(Two-way binding)
    U-->|Types in the input box|I
    I-->|Fires the 'input' event|CVA
    CVA-->|"Calls setValue() on the FormControl"|FC
    FC-.->|Fires a 'valueChanges' event to observers|O
    CVA-->|"Calls viewToModelUpdate()"|M
    M-->|Emits an ngModelChange event|C
    C-->|Updates the value of the two-way bound property|P
```

The model-to-view diagram shows how data flows from model to view when the `favoriteColor` changes from _Blue_ to _Red_, through the following steps

1. The `favoriteColor` value is updated in the component.
1. Change detection begins.
1. During change detection, the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook is called on the `NgModel` directive instance because the value of one of its inputs has changed.
1. The `ngOnChanges()` method queues an async task to set the value for the internal `FormControl` instance.
1. Change detection completes.
1. On the next tick, the task to set the `FormControl` instance value is executed.
1. The `FormControl` instance emits the latest value through the `valueChanges` observable.
1. Any subscribers to the `valueChanges` observable receive the new value.
1. The control value accessor updates the form input element in the view with the latest `favoriteColor` value.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    C(Component)
    P(Property bound to NgModel)
    C-->|Updates the property value|P
    P-->|Triggers CD|CD1


    subgraph CD1 [First Change Detection]
        direction TB
        M(NgModel)
        FC(FormControl)

        M-->|Asynchronously sets FormControl value|FC
    end
    CD1-->|Async actions trigger a second round of Change Detection|CD2

    subgraph CD2 [Second Change Detection]
        direction TB
        FC2(FormControl)
        O(Observers)
        CVA(ControlValueAccessor)

        FC2-.->|Fires a 'valueChanges' event to observers|O
        O-->|ControlValueAccessor receives valueChanges event|CVA
        CVA-->|Sets the value in the control|I
    end
```

NOTE: `NgModel` triggers a second change detection to avoid `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked` errors, because the value change originates in an input binding.

### Mutability of the data model

The change-tracking method plays a role in the efficiency of your application.

| Forms                 | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reactive forms        | Keep the data model pure by providing it as an immutable data structure. Each time a change is triggered on the data model, the `FormControl` instance returns a new data model rather than updating the existing data model. This gives you the ability to track unique changes to the data model through the control's observable. Change detection is more efficient because it only needs to update on unique changes. Because data updates follow reactive patterns, you can integrate with observable operators to transform data. |
| Template-driven forms | Rely on mutability with two-way data binding to update the data model in the component as changes are made in the template. Because there are no unique changes to track on the data model when using two-way data binding, change detection is less efficient at determining when updates are required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The difference is demonstrated in the previous examples that use the favorite-color input element.

- With reactive forms, the **`FormControl` instance** always returns a new value when the control's value is updated
- With template-driven forms, the **favorite color property** is always modified to its new value

## Form validation

Validation is an integral part of managing any set of forms.
Whether you're checking for required fields or querying an external API for an existing username, Angular provides a set of built-in validators as well as the ability to create custom validators.

| Forms                 | Details                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reactive forms        | Define custom validators as **functions** that receive a control to validate                                 |
| Template-driven forms | Tied to template **directives**, and must provide custom validator directives that wrap validation functions |

For more information, see [Form Validation](guide/forms/form-validation#validating-input-in-reactive-forms).

## Testing

Testing plays a large part in complex applications.
A simpler testing strategy is useful when validating that your forms function correctly.
Reactive forms and template-driven forms have different levels of reliance on rendering the UI to perform assertions based on form control and form field changes.
The following examples demonstrate the process of testing forms with reactive and template-driven forms.

### Testing reactive forms

Reactive forms provide a relatively straightforward testing strategy because they provide synchronous access to the form and data models, and they can be tested without rendering the UI.
In these tests, status and data are queried and manipulated through the control without interacting with the change detection cycle.

The following tests use the favorite-color components from previous examples to verify the view-to-model and model-to-view data flows for a reactive form.

<!--todo: make consistent with other topics -->

#### Verifying view-to-model data flow

The first example performs the following steps to verify the view-to-model data flow.

1. Query the view for the form input element, and create a custom "input" event for the test.
1. Set the new value for the input to _Red_, and dispatch the "input" event on the form input element.
1. Assert that the component's `favoriteColorControl` value matches the value from the input.

<docs-code header="Favorite color test - view to model" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/reactive/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="view-to-model"/>

The next example performs the following steps to verify the model-to-view data flow.

1. Use the `favoriteColorControl`, a `FormControl` instance, to set the new value.
1. Query the view for the form input element.
1. Assert that the new value set on the control matches the value in the input.

<docs-code header="Favorite color test - model to view" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/reactive/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="model-to-view"/>

### Testing template-driven forms

Writing tests with template-driven forms requires a detailed knowledge of the change detection process and an understanding of how directives run on each cycle to ensure that elements are queried, tested, or changed at the correct time.

The following tests use the favorite color components mentioned earlier to verify the data flows from view to model and model to view for a template-driven form.

The following test verifies the data flow from view to model.

<docs-code header="Favorite color test - view to model" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/template/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="view-to-model"/>

Here are the steps performed in the view to model test.

1. Query the view for the form input element, and create a custom "input" event for the test.
1. Set the new value for the input to _Red_, and dispatch the "input" event on the form input element.
1. Run change detection through the test fixture.
1. Assert that the component `favoriteColor` property value matches the value from the input.

The following test verifies the data flow from model to view.

<docs-code header="Favorite color test - model to view" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms-overview/src/app/template/favorite-color/favorite-color.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="model-to-view"/>

Here are the steps performed in the model to view test.

1. Use the component instance to set the value of the `favoriteColor` property.
1. Run change detection through the test fixture.
1. Use the `tick()` method to simulate the passage of time within the `fakeAsync()` task.
1. Query the view for the form input element.
1. Assert that the input value matches the value of the `favoriteColor` property in the component instance.

# Reactive forms

Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time.
This guide shows you how to create and update a basic form control, progress to using multiple controls in a group, validate form values, and create dynamic forms where you can add or remove controls at run time.

## Overview of reactive forms

Reactive forms use an explicit and immutable approach to managing the state of a form at a given point in time.
Each change to the form state returns a new state, which maintains the integrity of the model between changes.
Reactive forms are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values, which can be accessed synchronously.

Reactive forms also provide a straightforward path to testing because you are assured that your data is consistent and predictable when requested.
Any consumers of the streams have access to manipulate that data safely.

Reactive forms differ from [template-driven forms](guide/forms/template-driven-forms) in distinct ways.
Reactive forms provide synchronous access to the data model, immutability with observable operators, and change tracking through observable streams.

Template-driven forms let direct access modify data in your template, but are less explicit than reactive forms because they rely on directives embedded in the template, along with mutable data to track changes asynchronously.
See the [Forms Overview](guide/forms) for detailed comparisons between the two paradigms.

## Adding a basic form control

There are three steps to using form controls.

1. Generate a new component and register the reactive forms module. This module declares the reactive-form directives that you need to use reactive forms.
1. Instantiate a new `FormControl`.
1. Register the `FormControl` in the template.

You can then display the form by adding the component to the template.

The following examples show how to add a single form control.
In the example, the user enters their name into an input field, captures that input value, and displays the current value of the form control element.

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Generate a new component and import the ReactiveFormsModule">
Use the CLI command `ng generate component` to generate a component in your project and import `ReactiveFormsModule` from the `@angular/forms` package and add it to your Component's `imports` array.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="imports" />
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Declare a FormControl instance">
Use the constructor of `FormControl` to set its initial value, which in this case is an empty string. By creating these controls in your component class, you get immediate access to listen for, update, and validate the state of the form input.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="create-control"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Register the control in the template">
After you create the control in the component class, you must associate it with a form control element in the template. Update the template with the form control using the `formControl` binding provided by `FormControlDirective`, which is also included in the `ReactiveFormsModule`.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="control-binding" />

Using the template binding syntax, the form control is now registered to the `name` input element in the template. The form control and DOM element communicate with each other: the view reflects changes in the model, and the model reflects changes in the view.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Display the component">
The `FormControl` assigned to the `name` property is displayed when the `<app-name-editor>` component is added to a template.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (name editor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/app.component.1.html" visibleRegion="app-name-editor"/>
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

### Displaying a form control value

You can display the value in the following ways.

- Through the `valueChanges` observable where you can listen for changes in the form's value in the template using `AsyncPipe` or in the component class using the `subscribe()` method
- With the `value` property, which gives you a snapshot of the current value

The following example shows you how to display the current value using interpolation in the template.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html (control value)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="display-value"/>

The displayed value changes as you update the form control element.

Reactive forms provide access to information about a given control through properties and methods provided with each instance.
These properties and methods of the underlying [AbstractControl](api/forms/AbstractControl 'API reference') class are used to control form state and determine when to display messages when handling [input validation](#validating-form-input 'Learn more about validating form input').

Read about other `FormControl` properties and methods in the [API Reference](api/forms/FormControl 'Detailed syntax reference').

### Replacing a form control value

Reactive forms have methods to change a control's value programmatically, which gives you the flexibility to update the value without user interaction.
A form control instance provides a `setValue()` method that updates the value of the form control and validates the structure of the value provided against the control's structure.
For example, when retrieving form data from a backend API or service, use the `setValue()` method to update the control to its new value, replacing the old value entirely.

The following example adds a method to the component class to update the value of the control to _Nancy_ using the `setValue()` method.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts (update value)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="update-value"/>

Update the template with a button to simulate a name update.
When you click the **Update Name** button, the value entered in the form control element is reflected as its current value.

<docs-code header="src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html (update value)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/name-editor/name-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="update-value"/>

The form model is the source of truth for the control, so when you click the button, the value of the input is changed within the component class, overriding its current value.

HELPFUL: In this example, you're using a single control.
When using the `setValue()` method with a [form group](#grouping-form-controls) or [form array](#creating-dynamic-forms) instance, the value needs to match the structure of the group or array.

## Grouping form controls

Forms typically contain several related controls.
Reactive forms provide two ways of grouping multiple related controls into a single input form.

| Form groups | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Form group  | Defines a form with a fixed set of controls that you can manage together. Form group basics are discussed in this section. You can also [nest form groups](#creating-nested-form-groups 'See more about nesting groups') to create more complex forms. |
| Form array  | Defines a dynamic form, where you can add and remove controls at run time. You can also nest form arrays to create more complex forms. For more about this option, see [Creating dynamic forms](#creating-dynamic-forms).                              |

Just as a form control instance gives you control over a single input field, a form group instance tracks the form state of a group of form control instances \(for example, a form\).
Each control in a form group instance is tracked by name when creating the form group.
The following example shows how to manage multiple form control instances in a single group.

Generate a `ProfileEditor` component and import the `FormGroup` and `FormControl` classes from the `@angular/forms` package.

<docs-code language="shell">
ng generate component ProfileEditor
</docs-code>

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (imports)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="imports"/>

To add a form group to this component, take the following steps.

1. Create a `FormGroup` instance.
1. Associate the `FormGroup` model and view.
1. Save the form data.

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Create a FormGroup instance">
Create a property in the component class named `profileForm` and set the property to a new form group instance. To initialize the form group, provide the constructor with an object of named keys mapped to their control.

For the profile form, add two form control instances with the names `firstName` and `lastName`

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (form group)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="formgroup"/>

The individual form controls are now collected within a group. A `FormGroup` instance provides its model value as an object reduced from the values of each control in the group. A form group instance has the same properties (such as `value` and `untouched`) and methods (such as `setValue()`) as a form control instance.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Associate the FormGroup model and view">
A form group tracks the status and changes for each of its controls, so if one of the controls changes, the parent control also emits a new status or value change. The model for the group is maintained from its members. After you define the model, you must update the template to reflect the model in the view.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (template form group)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.html" visibleRegion="formgroup"/>

Just as a form group contains a group of controls, the _profileForm_ `FormGroup` is bound to the `form` element with the `FormGroup` directive, creating a communication layer between the model and the form containing the inputs. The `formControlName` input provided by the `FormControlName` directive binds each individual input to the form control defined in `FormGroup`. The form controls communicate with their respective elements. They also communicate changes to the form group instance, which provides the source of truth for the model value.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Save form data">
The `ProfileEditor` component accepts input from the user, but in a real scenario you want to capture the form value and make it available for further processing outside the component. The `FormGroup` directive listens for the `submit` event emitted by the `form` element and emits an `ngSubmit` event that you can bind to a callback function. Add an `ngSubmit` event listener to the `form` tag with the `onSubmit()` callback method.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (submit event)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="ng-submit"/>

The `onSubmit()` method in the `ProfileEditor` component captures the current value of `profileForm`. Use `EventEmitter` to keep the form encapsulated and to provide the form value outside the component. The following example uses `console.warn` to log a message to the browser console.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (submit method)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="on-submit"/>

The `submit` event is emitted by the `form` tag using the built-in DOM event. You trigger the event by clicking a button with `submit` type. This lets the user press the **Enter** key to submit the completed form.

Use a `button` element to add a button to the bottom of the form to trigger the form submission.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (submit button)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="submit-button"/>

The button in the preceding snippet also has a `disabled` binding attached to it to disable the button when `profileForm` is invalid. You aren't performing any validation yet, so the button is always enabled. Basic form validation is covered in the [Validating form input](#validating-form-input) section.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Display the component">
To display the `ProfileEditor` component that contains the form, add it to a component template.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html (profile editor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/app.component.1.html" visibleRegion="app-profile-editor"/>

`ProfileEditor` lets you manage the form control instances for the `firstName` and `lastName` controls within the form group instance.

### Creating nested form groups

Form groups can accept both individual form control instances and other form group instances as children.
This makes composing complex form models easier to maintain and logically group together.

When building complex forms, managing the different areas of information is easier in smaller sections.
Using a nested form group instance lets you break large forms groups into smaller, more manageable ones.

To make more complex forms, use the following steps.

1. Create a nested group.
1. Group the nested form in the template.

Some types of information naturally fall into the same group.
A name and address are typical examples of such nested groups, and are used in the following examples.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Create a nested group">
To create a nested group in `profileForm`, add a nested `address` element to the form group instance.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (nested form group)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="nested-formgroup"/>

In this example, `address group` combines the current `firstName` and `lastName` controls with the new `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip` controls. Even though the `address` element in the form group is a child of the overall `profileForm` element in the form group, the same rules apply with value and status changes. Changes in status and value from the nested form group propagate to the parent form group, maintaining consistency with the overall model.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Group the nested form in the template">
After you update the model in the component class, update the template to connect the form group instance and its input elements. Add the `address` form group containing the `street`, `city`, `state`, and `zip` fields to the `ProfileEditor` template.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (template nested form group)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.html" visibleRegion="formgroupname"/>

The `ProfileEditor` form is displayed as one group, but the model is broken down further to represent the logical grouping areas.

Display the value for the form group instance in the component template using the `value` property and `JsonPipe`.
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

### Updating parts of the data model

When updating the value for a form group instance that contains multiple controls, you might only want to update parts of the model.
This section covers how to update specific parts of a form control data model.

There are two ways to update the model value:

| Methods        | Details                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setValue()`   | Set a new value for an individual control. The `setValue()` method strictly adheres to the structure of the form group and replaces the entire value for the control. |
| `patchValue()` | Replace any properties defined in the object that have changed in the form model.                                                                                     |

The strict checks of the `setValue()` method help catch nesting errors in complex forms, while `patchValue()` fails silently on those errors.

In `ProfileEditorComponent`, use the `updateProfile` method with the following example to update the first name and street address for the user.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (patch value)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="patch-value"/>

Simulate an update by adding a button to the template to update the user profile on demand.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (update value)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.html" visibleRegion="patch-value"/>

When a user clicks the button, the `profileForm` model is updated with new values for `firstName` and `street`. Notice that `street` is provided in an object inside the `address` property.
This is necessary because the `patchValue()` method applies the update against the model structure.
`PatchValue()` only updates properties that the form model defines.

## Using the FormBuilder service to generate controls

Creating form control instances manually can become repetitive when dealing with multiple forms.
The `FormBuilder` service provides convenient methods for generating controls.

Use the following steps to take advantage of this service.

1. Import the `FormBuilder` class.
1. Inject the `FormBuilder` service.
1. Generate the form contents.

The following examples show how to refactor the `ProfileEditor` component to use the form builder service to create form control and form group instances.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Import the FormBuilder class">
Import the `FormBuilder` class from the `@angular/forms` package.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="form-builder-imports"/>

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Inject the FormBuilder service">
The `FormBuilder` service is an injectable provider from the reactive forms module. Use the `inject()` function to inject this dependency in your component.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (property init)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="inject-form-builder"/>

</docs-step>
<docs-step title="Generate form controls">
The `FormBuilder` service has three methods: `control()`, `group()`, and `array()`. These are factory methods for generating instances in your component classes including form controls, form groups, and form arrays. Use the `group` method to create the `profileForm` controls.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (form builder)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="form-builder"/>

In the preceding example, you use the `group()` method with the same object to define the properties in the model. The value for each control name is an array containing the initial value as the first item in the array.

TIP: You can define the control with just the initial value, but if your controls need sync or async validation, add sync and async validators as the second and third items in the array. Compare using the form builder to creating the instances manually.

  <docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (instances)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.1.ts" visibleRegion="formgroup-compare"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (form builder)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="formgroup-compare"/>
  </docs-code-multifile>
</docs-step>

</docs-workflow>

## Validating form input

_Form validation_ is used to ensure that user input is complete and correct.
This section covers adding a single validator to a form control and displaying the overall form status.
Form validation is covered more extensively in the [Form Validation](guide/forms/form-validation) guide.

Use the following steps to add form validation.

1. Import a validator function in your form component.
1. Add the validator to the field in the form.
1. Add logic to handle the validation status.

The most common validation is making a field required.
The following example shows how to add a required validation to the `firstName` control and display the result of validation.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Import a validator function">
Reactive forms include a set of validator functions for common use cases. These functions receive a control to validate against and return an error object or a null value based on the validation check.

Import the `Validators` class from the `@angular/forms` package.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="validator-imports"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Make a field required">
In the `ProfileEditor` component, add the `Validators.required` static method as the second item in the array for the `firstName` control.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (required validator)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="required-validator"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Display form status">
When you add a required field to the form control, its initial status is invalid. This invalid status propagates to the parent form group element, making its status invalid. Access the current status of the form group instance through its `status` property.

Display the current status of `profileForm` using interpolation.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (display status)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="display-status"/>

The **Submit** button is disabled because `profileForm` is invalid due to the required `firstName` form control. After you fill out the `firstName` input, the form becomes valid and the **Submit** button is enabled.

For more on form validation, visit the [Form Validation](guide/forms/form-validation) guide.
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

## Creating dynamic forms

`FormArray` is an alternative to `FormGroup` for managing any number of unnamed controls.
As with form group instances, you can dynamically insert and remove controls from form array instances, and the form array instance value and validation status is calculated from its child controls.
However, you don't need to define a key for each control by name, so this is a great option if you don't know the number of child values in advance.

To define a dynamic form, take the following steps.

1. Import the `FormArray` class.
1. Define a `FormArray` control.
1. Access the `FormArray` control with a getter method.
1. Display the form array in a template.

The following example shows you how to manage an array of _aliases_ in `ProfileEditor`.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Import the `FormArray` class">
Import the `FormArray` class from `@angular/forms` to use for type information. The `FormBuilder` service is ready to create a `FormArray` instance.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.2.ts" visibleRegion="form-array-imports"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Define a `FormArray` control">
You can initialize a form array with any number of controls, from zero to many, by defining them in an array. Add an `aliases` property to the form group instance for `profileForm` to define the form array.

Use the `FormBuilder.array()` method to define the array, and the `FormBuilder.control()` method to populate the array with an initial control.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (aliases form array)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="aliases"/>

The aliases control in the form group instance is now populated with a single control until more controls are added dynamically.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Access the `FormArray` control">
A getter provides access to the aliases in the form array instance compared to repeating the `profileForm.get()` method to get each instance. The form array instance represents an undefined number of controls in an array. It's convenient to access a control through a getter, and this approach is straightforward to repeat for additional controls. <br />

Use the getter syntax to create an `aliases` class property to retrieve the alias's form array control from the parent form group.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (aliases getter)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="aliases-getter"/>

Because the returned control is of the type `AbstractControl`, you need to provide an explicit type to access the method syntax for the form array instance. Define a method to dynamically insert an alias control into the alias's form array. The `FormArray.push()` method inserts the control as a new item in the array.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts (add alias)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.ts" visibleRegion="add-alias"/>

In the template, each control is displayed as a separate input field.

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Display the form array in the template">

To attach the aliases from your form model, you must add it to the template. Similar to the `formGroupName` input provided by `FormGroupNameDirective`, `formArrayName` binds communication from the form array instance to the template with `FormArrayNameDirective`.

Add the following template HTML after the `<div>` closing the `formGroupName` element.

<docs-code header="src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html (aliases form array template)" path="adev/src/content/examples/reactive-forms/src/app/profile-editor/profile-editor.component.html" visibleRegion="formarrayname"/>

The `*ngFor` directive iterates over each form control instance provided by the aliases form array instance. Because form array elements are unnamed, you assign the index to the `i` variable and pass it to each control to bind it to the `formControlName` input.

Each time a new alias instance is added, the new form array instance is provided its control based on the index. This lets you track each individual control when calculating the status and value of the root control.

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Add an alias">

Initially, the form contains one `Alias` field. To add another field, click the **Add Alias** button. You can also validate the array of aliases reported by the form model displayed by `Form Value` at the bottom of the template. Instead of a form control instance for each alias, you can compose another form group instance with additional fields. The process of defining a control for each item is the same.
</docs-step>

</docs-workflow>

## Reactive forms API summary

The following table lists the base classes and services used to create and manage reactive form controls.
For complete syntax details, see the API reference documentation for the [Forms package](api#forms 'API reference').

### Classes

| Class             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AbstractControl` | The abstract base class for the concrete form control classes `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray`. It provides their common behaviors and properties.                           |
| `FormControl`     | Manages the value and validity status of an individual form control. It corresponds to an HTML form control such as `<input>` or `<select>`.                                            |
| `FormGroup`       | Manages the value and validity state of a group of `AbstractControl` instances. The group's properties include its child controls. The top-level form in your component is `FormGroup`. |
| `FormArray`       | Manages the value and validity state of a numerically indexed array of `AbstractControl` instances.                                                                                     |
| `FormBuilder`     | An injectable service that provides factory methods for creating control instances.                                                                                                     |
| `FormRecord`      | Tracks the value and validity state of a collection of `FormControl` instances, each of which has the same value type.                                                                  |

### Directives

| Directive              | Details                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FormControlDirective` | Syncs a standalone `FormControl` instance to a form control element.                       |
| `FormControlName`      | Syncs `FormControl` in an existing `FormGroup` instance to a form control element by name. |
| `FormGroupDirective`   | Syncs an existing `FormGroup` instance to a DOM element.                                   |
| `FormGroupName`        | Syncs a nested `FormGroup` instance to a DOM element.                                      |

# Building a template-driven form

This tutorial shows you how to create a template-driven form. The control elements in the form are bound to data properties that have input validation. The input validation helps maintain data integrity and styling to improve the user experience.

Template-driven forms use [two-way data binding](guide/templates/two-way-binding) to update the data model in the component as changes are made in the template and vice versa.

<docs-callout helpful title="Template vs Reactive forms">
Angular supports two design approaches for interactive forms. Template-driven forms allow you to use form-specific directives in your Angular template. Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to building forms.

Template-driven forms are a great choice for small or simple forms, while reactive forms are more scalable and suitable for complex forms. For a comparison of the two approaches, see [Choosing an approach](guide/forms#choosing-an-approach)
</docs-callout>

You can build almost any kind of form with an Angular template —login forms, contact forms, and pretty much any business form.
You can lay out the controls creatively and bind them to the data in your object model.
You can specify validation rules and display validation errors, conditionally allow input from specific controls, trigger built-in visual feedback, and much more.

## Objectives

This tutorial teaches you how to do the following:

- Build an Angular form with a component and template
- Use `ngModel` to create two-way data bindings for reading and writing input-control values
- Provide visual feedback using special CSS classes that track the state of the controls
- Display validation errors to users and conditionally allow input from form controls based on the form status
- Share information across HTML elements using [template reference variables](guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables)

## Build a template-driven form

Template-driven forms rely on directives defined in the `FormsModule`.

| Directives     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NgModel`      | Reconciles value changes in the attached form element with changes in the data model, allowing you to respond to user input with input validation and error handling.                                                                                                           |
| `NgForm`       | Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a `<form>` element to track aggregated form value and validation status. As soon as you import `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on all `<form>` tags. You don't need to add a special selector. |
| `NgModelGroup` | Creates and binds a `FormGroup` instance to a DOM element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Step overview

In the course of this tutorial, you bind a sample form to data and handle user input using the following steps.

1. Build the basic form.
   - Define a sample data model
   - Include required infrastructure such as the `FormsModule`
1. Bind form controls to data properties using the `ngModel` directive and two-way data-binding syntax.
   - Examine how `ngModel` reports control states using CSS classes
   - Name controls to make them accessible to `ngModel`
1. Track input validity and control status using `ngModel`.
   - Add custom CSS to provide visual feedback on the status
   - Show and hide validation-error messages
1. Respond to a native HTML button-click event by adding to the model data.
1. Handle form submission using the [`ngSubmit`](api/forms/NgForm#properties) output property of the form.
   - Disable the **Submit** button until the form is valid
   - After submit, swap out the finished form for different content on the page

## Build the form

<!-- TODO: link to preview -->
<!-- <docs-code live/> -->

1. The provided sample application creates the `Actor` class which defines the data model reflected in the form.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor.ts" language="typescript" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor.ts"/>

1. The form layout and details are defined in the `ActorFormComponent` class.

   <docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts (v1)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts" visibleRegion="v1"/>

   The component's `selector` value of "app-actor-form" means you can drop this form in a parent template using the `<app-actor-form>` tag.

1. The following code creates a new actor instance, so that the initial form can show an example actor.

   <docs-code language="typescript" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts" language="typescript" visibleRegion="Marilyn"/>

   This demo uses dummy data for `model` and `skills`.
   In a real app, you would inject a data service to get and save real data, or expose these properties as inputs and outputs.

1. The component enables the Forms feature by importing the `FormsModule` module.

   <docs-code language="typescript" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts" language="typescript" visibleRegion="imports"/>

1. The form is displayed in the application layout defined by the root component's template.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" language="html" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/app.component.html"/>

   The initial template defines the layout for a form with two form groups and a submit button.
   The form groups correspond to two properties of the Actor data model, name and studio.
   Each group has a label and a box for user input.

   - The **Name** `<input>` control element has the HTML5 `required` attribute
   - The **Studio** `<input>` control element does not because `studio` is optional

   The **Submit** button has some classes on it for styling.
   At this point, the form layout is all plain HTML5, with no bindings or directives.

1. The sample form uses some style classes from [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/css): `container`, `form-group`, `form-control`, and `btn`.
   To use these styles, the application's style sheet imports the library.

<docs-code header="src/styles.css" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/styles.1.css"/>

1. The form requires that an actor's skill is chosen from a predefined list of `skills` maintained internally in `ActorFormComponent`.
   The Angular [NgForOf directive](api/common/NgForOf 'API reference') iterates over the data values to populate the `<select>` element.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (skills)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="skills"/>

If you run the application right now, you see the list of skills in the selection control.
The input elements are not yet bound to data values or events, so they are still blank and have no behavior.

## Bind input controls to data properties

The next step is to bind the input controls to the corresponding `Actor` properties with two-way data binding, so that they respond to user input by updating the data model, and also respond to programmatic changes in the data by updating the display.

The `ngModel` directive declared in the `FormsModule` lets you bind controls in your template-driven form to properties in your data model.
When you include the directive using the syntax for two-way data binding, `[(ngModel)]`, Angular can track the value and user interaction of the control and keep the view synced with the model.

1. Edit the template file `actor-form.component.html`.
1. Find the `<input>` tag next to the **Name** label.
1. Add the `ngModel` directive, using two-way data binding syntax `[(ngModel)]="..."`.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="ngModelName-1"/>

HELPFUL: This example has a temporary diagnostic interpolation after each input tag, `{{model.name}}`, to show the current data value of the corresponding property. The comment reminds you to remove the diagnostic lines when you have finished observing the two-way data binding at work.

### Access the overall form status

When you imported the `FormsModule` in your component, Angular automatically created and attached an [NgForm](api/forms/NgForm) directive to the `<form>` tag in the template (because `NgForm` has the selector `form` that matches `<form>` elements).

To get access to the `NgForm` and the overall form status, declare a [template reference variable](guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables).

1. Edit the template file `actor-form.component.html`.
1. Update the `<form>` tag with a template reference variable, `#actorForm`, and set its value as follows.

   <docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="template-variable"/>

   The `actorForm` template variable is now a reference to the `NgForm` directive instance that governs the form as a whole.

1. Run the app.
1. Start typing in the **Name** input box.

   As you add and delete characters, you can see them appear and disappear from the data model.

The diagnostic line that shows interpolated values demonstrates that values are really flowing from the input box to the model and back again.

### Naming control elements

When you use `[(ngModel)]` on an element, you must define a `name` attribute for that element.
Angular uses the assigned name to register the element with the `NgForm` directive attached to the parent `<form>` element.

The example added a `name` attribute to the `<input>` element and set it to "name", which makes sense for the actor's name.
Any unique value will do, but using a descriptive name is helpful.

1. Add similar `[(ngModel)]` bindings and `name` attributes to **Studio** and **Skill**.
1. You can now remove the diagnostic messages that show interpolated values.
1. To confirm that two-way data binding works for the entire actor model, add a new text binding with the [`json`](api/common/JsonPipe) pipe at the top to the component's template, which serializes the data to a string.

After these revisions, the form template should look like the following:

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="ngModel-2"/>

You'll notice that:

- Each `<input>` element has an `id` property.
  This is used by the `<label>` element's `for` attribute to match the label to its input control.
  This is a [standard HTML feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

- Each `<input>` element also has the required `name` property that Angular uses to register the control with the form.

When you have observed the effects, you can delete the `{{ model | json }}` text binding.

## Track form states

Angular applies the `ng-submitted` class to `form` elements after the form has been submitted. This class can be used to change the form's style after it has been submitted.

## Track control states

Adding the `NgModel` directive to a control adds class names to the control that describe its state.
These classes can be used to change a control's style based on its state.

The following table describes the class names that Angular applies based on the control's state.

| States                           | Class if true | Class if false |
| :------------------------------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| The control has been visited.    | `ng-touched`  | `ng-untouched` |
| The control's value has changed. | `ng-dirty`    | `ng-pristine`  |
| The control's value is valid.    | `ng-valid`    | `ng-invalid`   |

Angular also applies the `ng-submitted` class to `form` elements upon submission,
but not to the controls inside the `form` element.

You use these CSS classes to define the styles for your control based on its status.

### Observe control states

To see how the classes are added and removed by the framework, open the browser's developer tools and inspect the `<input>` element that represents the actor name.

1. Using your browser's developer tools, find the `<input>` element that corresponds to the **Name** input box.
   You can see that the element has multiple CSS classes in addition to "form-control".

1. When you first bring it up, the classes indicate that it has a valid value, that the value has not been changed since initialization or reset, and that the control has not been visited since initialization or reset.

   <docs-code language="html">

   <input class="form-control ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid">;

   </docs-code>

1. Take the following actions on the **Name** `<input>` box, and observe which classes appear.

   - Look but don't touch.
     The classes indicate that it is untouched, pristine, and valid.

   - Click inside the name box, then click outside it.
     The control has now been visited, and the element has the `ng-touched` class instead of the `ng-untouched` class.

   - Add slashes to the end of the name.
     It is now touched and dirty.

   - Erase the name.
     This makes the value invalid, so the `ng-invalid` class replaces the `ng-valid` class.

### Create visual feedback for states

The `ng-valid`/`ng-invalid` pair is particularly interesting, because you want to send a
strong visual signal when the values are invalid.
You also want to mark required fields.

You can mark required fields and invalid data at the same time with a colored bar
on the left of the input box.

To change the appearance in this way, take the following steps.

1. Add definitions for the `ng-*` CSS classes.
1. Add these class definitions to a new `forms.css` file.
1. Add the new file to the project as a sibling to `index.html`:

<docs-code header="src/assets/forms.css" language="css" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/assets/forms.css"/>

1. In the `index.html` file, update the `<head>` tag to include the new style sheet.

<docs-code header="src/index.html (styles)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/index.html" visibleRegion="styles"/>

### Show and hide validation error messages

The **Name** input box is required and clearing it turns the bar red.
That indicates that something is wrong, but the user doesn't know what is wrong or what to do about it.
You can provide a helpful message by checking for and responding to the control's state.

The **Skill** select box is also required, but it doesn't need this kind of error handling because the selection box already constrains the selection to valid values.

To define and show an error message when appropriate, take the following steps.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Add a local reference to the input">
Extend the `input` tag with a template reference variable that you can use to access the input box's Angular control from within the template. In the example, the variable is `#name="ngModel"`.

The template reference variable (`#name`) is set to `"ngModel"` because that is the value of the [`NgModel.exportAs`](api/core/Directive#exportAs) property. This property tells Angular how to link a reference variable to a directive.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Add the error message">
Add a `<div>` that contains a suitable error message.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Make the error message conditional">
Show or hide the error message by binding properties of the `name` control to the message `<div>` element's `hidden` property.
</docs-step>

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (hidden-error-msg)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="hidden-error-msg"/>

<docs-step title="Add a conditional error message to name">
Add a conditional error message to the `name` input box, as in the following example.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="name-with-error-msg"/>
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

<docs-callout title='Illustrating the "pristine" state'>

In this example, you hide the message when the control is either valid or _pristine_.
Pristine means the user hasn't changed the value since it was displayed in this form.
If you ignore the `pristine` state, you would hide the message only when the value is valid.
If you arrive in this component with a new, blank actor or an invalid actor, you'll see the error message immediately, before you've done anything.

You might want the message to display only when the user makes an invalid change.
Hiding the message while the control is in the `pristine` state achieves that goal.
You'll see the significance of this choice when you add a new actor to the form in the next step.

</docs-callout>

## Add a new actor

This exercise shows how you can respond to a native HTML button-click event by adding to the model data.
To let form users add a new actor, you will add a **New Actor** button that responds to a click event.

1. In the template, place a "New Actor" `<button>` element at the bottom of the form.
1. In the component file, add the actor-creation method to the actor data model.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts (New Actor method)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts" visibleRegion="new-actor"/>

1. Bind the button's click event to an actor-creation method, `newActor()`.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (New Actor button)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="new-actor-button-no-reset"/>

1. Run the application again and click the **New Actor** button.

   The form clears, and the _required_ bars to the left of the input box are red, indicating invalid `name` and `skill` properties.
   Notice that the error messages are hidden.
   This is because the form is pristine; you haven't changed anything yet.

1. Enter a name and click **New Actor** again.

   Now the application displays a `Name is required` error message, because the input box is no longer pristine.
   The form remembers that you entered a name before clicking **New Actor**.

1. To restore the pristine state of the form controls, clear all of the flags imperatively by calling the form's `reset()` method after calling the `newActor()` method.

   <docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (Reset the form)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="new-actor-button-form-reset"/>

   Now clicking **New Actor** resets both the form and its control flags.

## Submit the form with `ngSubmit`

The user should be able to submit this form after filling it in.
The **Submit** button at the bottom of the form does nothing on its own, but it does trigger a form-submit event because of its type (`type="submit"`).

To respond to this event, take the following steps.

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Listen to ngOnSubmit">
Bind the form's [`ngSubmit`](api/forms/NgForm#properties) event property to the actor-form component's `onSubmit()` method.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (ngSubmit)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="ngSubmit"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Bind the disabled property">
Use the template reference variable, `#actorForm` to access the form that contains the **Submit** button and create an event binding.

You will bind the form property that indicates its overall validity to the **Submit** button's `disabled` property.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (submit-button)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="submit-button"/>
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Run the application">
Notice that the button is enabled —although it doesn't do anything useful yet.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Delete the Name value">
This violates the "required" rule, so it displays the error message —and notice that it also disables the **Submit** button.

You didn't have to explicitly wire the button's enabled state to the form's validity.
The `FormsModule` did this automatically when you defined a template reference variable on the enhanced form element, then referred to that variable in the button control.
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

### Respond to form submission

To show a response to form submission, you can hide the data entry area and display something else in its place.

<docs-workflow>
<docs-step title="Wrap the form">
Wrap the entire form in a `<div>` and bind its `hidden` property to the `ActorFormComponent.submitted` property.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="edit-div"/>

The main form is visible from the start because the `submitted` property is false until you submit the form, as this fragment from the `ActorFormComponent` shows:

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts (submitted)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.ts" visibleRegion="submitted"/>

When you click the **Submit** button, the `submitted` flag becomes true and the form disappears.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Add the submitted state">
To show something else while the form is in the submitted state, add the following HTML below the new `<div>` wrapper.

<docs-code header="src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/forms/src/app/actor-form/actor-form.component.html" visibleRegion="submitted"/>

This `<div>`, which shows a read-only actor with interpolation bindings, appears only while the component is in the submitted state.

The alternative display includes an _Edit_ button whose click event is bound to an expression that clears the `submitted` flag.
</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Test the Edit button">
Click the *Edit* button to switch the display back to the editable form.
</docs-step>
</docs-workflow>

## Summary

The Angular form discussed in this page takes advantage of the following
framework features to provide support for data modification, validation, and more.

- An Angular HTML form template
- A form component class with a `@Component` decorator
- Handling form submission by binding to the `NgForm.ngSubmit` event property
- Template-reference variables such as `#actorForm` and `#name`
- `[(ngModel)]` syntax for two-way data binding
- The use of `name` attributes for validation and form-element change tracking
- The reference variable's `valid` property on input controls indicates whether a control is valid or should show error messages
- Controlling the **Submit** button's enabled state by binding to `NgForm` validity
- Custom CSS classes that provide visual feedback to users about controls that are not valid

Here's the code for the final version of the application:

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/forms/typed-forms.md
================================================
# Typed Forms

As of Angular 14, reactive forms are strictly typed by default.

As background for this guide, you should already be familiar with [Angular Reactive Forms](guide/forms/reactive-forms).

## Overview of Typed Forms

<docs-video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-odCf4MfJc" alt="Typed Forms in Angular" />

With Angular reactive forms, you explicitly specify a *form model*. As a simple example, consider this basic user login form:

```ts
const login = new FormGroup({
  email: new FormControl(''),
  password: new FormControl(''),
});
```

Angular provides many APIs for interacting with this `FormGroup`. For example, you may call `login.value`, `login.controls`, `login.patchValue`, etc. (For a full API reference, see the [API documentation](api/forms/FormGroup).)

In previous Angular versions, most of these APIs included `any` somewhere in their types, and interacting with the structure of the controls, or the values themselves, was not type-safe. For example: you could write the following invalid code:

```ts
const emailDomain = login.value.email.domain;
```

With strictly typed reactive forms, the above code does not compile, because there is no `domain` property on `email`.

In addition to the added safety, the types enable a variety of other improvements, such as better autocomplete in IDEs, and an explicit way to specify form structure.

These improvements currently apply only to *reactive* forms (not [*template-driven* forms](guide/forms/template-driven-forms)).

## Untyped Forms

Non-typed forms are still supported, and will continue to work as before. To use them, you must import the `Untyped` symbols from `@angular/forms`:

```ts
const login = new UntypedFormGroup({
  email: new UntypedFormControl(''),
  password: new UntypedFormControl(''),
});
```

Each `Untyped` symbol has exactly the same semantics as in previous Angular version. By removing the `Untyped` prefixes, you can incrementally enable the types.

## `FormControl`: Getting Started

The simplest possible form consists of a single control:

```ts
const email = new FormControl('angularrox@gmail.com');
```

This control will be automatically inferred to have the type `FormControl<string|null>`. TypeScript will automatically enforce this type throughout the [`FormControl` API](api/forms/FormControl), such as `email.value`, `email.valueChanges`, `email.setValue(...)`, etc.

### Nullability

You might wonder: why does the type of this control include `null`?  This is because the control can become `null` at any time, by calling reset:

```ts
const email = new FormControl('angularrox@gmail.com');
email.reset();
console.log(email.value); // null
```

TypeScript will enforce that you always handle the possibility that the control has become `null`. If you want to make this control non-nullable, you may use the `nonNullable` option. This will cause the control to reset to its initial value, instead of `null`:

```ts
const email = new FormControl('angularrox@gmail.com', {nonNullable: true});
email.reset();
console.log(email.value); // angularrox@gmail.com
```

To reiterate, this option affects the runtime behavior of your form when `.reset()` is called, and should be flipped with care.

### Specifying an Explicit Type

It is possible to specify the type, instead of relying on inference. Consider a control that is initialized to `null`. Because the initial value is `null`, TypeScript will infer `FormControl<null>`, which is narrower than we want.

```ts
const email = new FormControl(null);
email.setValue('angularrox@gmail.com'); // Error!
```

To prevent this, we explicitly specify the type as `string|null`:

```ts
const email = new FormControl<string|null>(null);
email.setValue('angularrox@gmail.com');
```

## `FormArray`: Dynamic, Homogenous Collections

A `FormArray` contains an open-ended list of controls. The type parameter corresponds to the type of each inner control:

```ts
const names = new FormArray([new FormControl('Alex')]);
names.push(new FormControl('Jess'));
```

This `FormArray` will have the inner controls type `FormControl<string|null>`.

If you want to have multiple different element types inside the array, you must use `UntypedFormArray`, because TypeScript cannot infer which element type will occur at which position.

## `FormGroup` and `FormRecord`

Angular provides the `FormGroup` type for forms with an enumerated set of keys, and a type called `FormRecord`, for open-ended or dynamic groups.

### Partial Values

Consider again a login form:

```ts
const login = new FormGroup({
    email: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),
    password: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),
});
```

On any `FormGroup`, it is [possible to disable controls](api/forms/FormGroup). Any disabled control will not appear in the group's value.

As a consequence, the type of `login.value` is `Partial<{email: string, password: string}>`. The `Partial` in this type means that each member might be undefined.

More specifically, the type of `login.value.email` is `string|undefined`, and TypeScript will enforce that you handle the possibly `undefined` value (if you have `strictNullChecks` enabled).

If you want to access the value *including* disabled controls, and thus bypass possible `undefined` fields, you can use `login.getRawValue()`.

### Optional Controls and Dynamic Groups

Some forms have controls that may or may not be present, which can be added and removed at runtime. You can represent these controls using *optional fields*:

```ts
interface LoginForm {
  email: FormControl<string>;
  password?: FormControl<string>;
}

const login = new FormGroup<LoginForm>({
  email: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),
  password: new FormControl('', {nonNullable: true}),
});

login.removeControl('password');
```

In this form, we explicitly specify the type, which allows us to make the `password` control optional. TypeScript will enforce that only optional controls can be added or removed.

### `FormRecord`

Some `FormGroup` usages do not fit the above pattern because the keys are not known ahead of time. The `FormRecord` class is designed for that case:

```ts
const addresses = new FormRecord<FormControl<string|null>>({});
addresses.addControl('Andrew', new FormControl('2340 Folsom St'));
```

Any control of type `string|null` can be added to this `FormRecord`.

If you need a `FormGroup` that is both dynamic (open-ended) and heterogeneous (the controls are different types), no improved type safety is possible, and you should use `UntypedFormGroup`.

A `FormRecord` can also be built with the `FormBuilder`:

```ts
const addresses = fb.record({'Andrew': '2340 Folsom St'});
```

## `FormBuilder` and `NonNullableFormBuilder`

The `FormBuilder` class has been upgraded to support the new types as well, in the same manner as the above examples.

Additionally, an additional builder is available: `NonNullableFormBuilder`. This type is shorthand for specifying `{nonNullable: true}` on every control, and can eliminate significant boilerplate from large non-nullable forms. You can access it using the `nonNullable` property on a `FormBuilder`:

```ts
const fb = new FormBuilder();
const login = fb.nonNullable.group({
  email: '',
  password: '',
});
```

On the above example, both inner controls will be non-nullable (i.e. `nonNullable` will be set).

You can also inject it using the name `NonNullableFormBuilder`.

================================================
# Interceptors

`HttpClient` supports a form of middleware known as _interceptors_.

TLDR: Interceptors are middleware that allows common patterns around retrying, caching, logging, and authentication to be abstracted away from individual requests.

`HttpClient` supports two kinds of interceptors: functional and DI-based. Our recommendation is to use functional interceptors because they have more predictable behavior, especially in complex setups. Our examples in this guide use functional interceptors, and we cover [DI-based interceptors](#di-based-interceptors) in their own section at the end.

## Interceptors

Interceptors are generally functions which you can run for each request, and have broad capabilities to affect the contents and overall flow of requests and responses. You can install multiple interceptors, which form an interceptor chain where each interceptor processes the request or response before forwarding it to the next interceptor in the chain.

You can use interceptors to implement a variety of common patterns, such as:

* Adding authentication headers to outgoing requests to a particular API.
* Retrying failed requests with exponential backoff.
* Caching responses for a period of time, or until invalidated by mutations.
* Customizing the parsing of responses.
* Measuring server response times and log them.
* Driving UI elements such as a loading spinner while network operations are in progress.
* Collecting and batch requests made within a certain timeframe.
* Automatically failing requests after a configurable deadline or timeout.
* Regularly polling the server and refreshing results.

## Defining an interceptor

The basic form of an interceptor is a function which receives the outgoing `HttpRequest` and a `next` function representing the next processing step in the interceptor chain.

For example, this `loggingInterceptor` will log the outgoing request URL to `console.log` before forwarding the request:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  console.log(req.url);
  return next(req);
}
</docs-code>

In order for this interceptor to actually intercept requests, you must configure `HttpClient` to use it.

## Configuring interceptors

You declare the set of interceptors to use when configuring `HttpClient` through dependency injection, by using the `withInterceptors` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    withInterceptors([loggingInterceptor, cachingInterceptor]),
  )
]});
</docs-code>

The interceptors you configure are chained together in the order that you've listed them in the providers. In the above example, the `loggingInterceptor` would process the request and then forward it to the `cachingInterceptor`.

### Intercepting response events

An interceptor may transform the `Observable` stream of `HttpEvent`s returned by `next` in order to access or manipulate the response. Because this stream includes all response events, inspecting the `.type` of each event may be necessary in order to identify the final response object.

<docs-code language="ts">
export function loggingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  return next(req).pipe(tap(event => {
    if (event.type === HttpEventType.Response) {
      console.log(req.url, 'returned a response with status', event.status);
    }
  }));
}
</docs-code>

TIP: Interceptors naturally associate responses with their outgoing requests, because they transform the response stream in a closure that captures the request object.

## Modifying requests

Most aspects of `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` instances are _immutable_, and interceptors cannot directly modify them. Instead, interceptors apply mutations by cloning these objects using the `.clone()` operation, and specifying which properties should be mutated in the new instance. This might involve performing immutable updates on the value itself (like `HttpHeaders` or `HttpParams`).

For example, to add a header to a request:

<docs-code language="ts">
const reqWithHeader = req.clone({
  headers: req.headers.set('X-New-Header', 'new header value'),
});
</docs-code>

This immutability allows most interceptors to be idempotent if the same `HttpRequest` is submitted to the interceptor chain multiple times. This can happen for a few reasons, including when a request is retried after failure.

CRITICAL: The body of a request or response is **not** protected from deep mutations. If an interceptor must mutate the body, take care to handle running multiple times on the same request.

## Dependency injection in interceptors

Interceptors are run in the _injection context_ of the injector which registered them, and can use  Angular's `inject` API to retrieve dependencies.

For example, suppose an application has a service called `AuthService`, which creates authentication tokens for outgoing requests. An interceptor can inject and use this service:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function authInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn) {
  // Inject the current `AuthService` and use it to get an authentication token:
  const authToken = inject(AuthService).getAuthToken();

  // Clone the request to add the authentication header.
  const newReq = req.clone({
    headers: req.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', authToken),
  });
  return next(newReq);
}
</docs-code>

## Request and response metadata

Often it's useful to include information in a request that's not sent to the backend, but is specifically meant for interceptors. `HttpRequest`s have a `.context` object which stores this kind of metadata as an instance of `HttpContext`. This object functions as a typed map, with keys of type `HttpContextToken`.

To illustrate how this system works, let's use metadata to control whether a caching interceptor is enabled for a given request.

### Defining context tokens

To store whether the caching interceptor should cache a particular request in that request's `.context` map, define a new `HttpContextToken` to act as a key:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const CACHING_ENABLED = new HttpContextToken<boolean>(() => true);
</docs-code>

The provided function creates the default value for the token for requests that haven't explicitly set a value for it. Using a function ensures that if the token's value is an object or array, each request gets its own instance.

### Reading the token in an interceptor

An interceptor can then read the token and choose to apply caching logic or not based on its value:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function cachingInterceptor(req: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  if (req.context.get(CACHING_ENABLED)) {
    // apply caching logic
    return ...;
  } else {
    // caching has been disabled for this request
    return next(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

### Setting context tokens when making a request

When making a request via the `HttpClient` API, you can provide values for `HttpContextToken`s:

<docs-code language="ts">
const data$ = http.get('/sensitive/data', {
  context: new HttpContext().set(CACHING_ENABLED, false),
});
</docs-code>

Interceptors can read these values from the `HttpContext` of the request.

### The request context is mutable

Unlike other properties of `HttpRequest`s, the associated `HttpContext` is _mutable_. If an interceptor changes the context of a request that is later retried, the same interceptor will observe the context mutation when it runs again. This is useful for passing state across multiple retries if needed.

## Synthetic responses

Most interceptors will simply invoke the `next` handler while transforming either the request or the response, but this is not strictly a requirement. This section discusses several of the ways in which an interceptor may incorporate more advanced behavior.

Interceptors are not required to invoke `next`. They may instead choose to construct responses through some other mechanism, such as from a cache or by sending the request through an alternate mechanism.

Constructing a response is possible using the `HttpResponse` constructor:

<docs-code language="ts">
const resp = new HttpResponse({
  body: 'response body',
});
</docs-code>

## DI-based interceptors

`HttpClient` also supports interceptors which are defined as injectable classes and configured through the DI system. The capabilities of DI-based interceptors are identical to those of functional interceptors, but the configuration mechanism is different.

A DI-based interceptor is an injectable class which implements the `HttpInterceptor` interface:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, handler: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    console.log('Request URL: ' + req.url);
    return handler.handle(req);
  }
}
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors are configured through a dependency injection multi-provider:

<docs-code language="ts">
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {providers: [
  provideHttpClient(
    // DI-based interceptors must be explicitly enabled.
    withInterceptorsFromDi(),
  ),

  {provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: LoggingInterceptor, multi: true},
]});
</docs-code>

DI-based interceptors run in the order that their providers are registered. In an app with an extensive and hierarchical DI configuration, this order can be very hard to predict.

# Making HTTP requests

`HttpClient` has methods corresponding to the different HTTP verbs used to make requests, both to load data and to apply mutations on the server. Each method returns an [RxJS `Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) which, when subscribed, sends the request and then emits the results when the server responds.

NOTE: `Observable`s created by `HttpClient` may be subscribed any number of times and will make a new backend request for each subscription.

Through an options object passed to the request method, various properties of the request and the returned response type can be adjusted.

## Fetching JSON data

Fetching data from a backend often requires making a GET request using the [`HttpClient.get()`](api/common/http/HttpClient#get) method. This method takes two arguments: the string endpoint URL from which to fetch, and an *optional options* object to configure the request.

For example, to fetch configuration data from a hypothetical API using the `HttpClient.get()` method:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get<Config>('/api/config').subscribe(config => {
  // process the configuration.
});
</docs-code>

Note the generic type argument which specifies that the data returned by the server will be of type `Config`. This argument is optional, and if you omit it then the returned data will have type `Object`.

TIP: When dealing with data of uncertain structure and potential `undefined` or `null` values, consider using the `unknown` type instead of `Object` as the response type.

CRITICAL: The generic type of request methods is a type **assertion** about the data returned by the server. `HttpClient` does not verify that the actual return data matches this type.

## Fetching other types of data

By default, `HttpClient` assumes that servers will return JSON data. When interacting with a non-JSON API, you can tell `HttpClient` what response type to expect and return when making the request. This is done with the `responseType` option.

| **`responseType` value** | **Returned response type** |
| - | - |
| `'json'` (default) | JSON data of the given generic type |
| `'text'` | string data |
| `'arraybuffer'` | [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) containing the raw response bytes |
| `'blob'` | [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) instance |

For example, you can ask `HttpClient` to download the raw bytes of a `.jpeg` image into an `ArrayBuffer`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/images/dog.jpg', {responseType: 'arraybuffer'}).subscribe(buffer => {
  console.log('The image is ' + buffer.byteLength + ' bytes large');
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `responseType`">
Because the value of `responseType` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `responseType: 'text' as const`.
</docs-callout>

## Mutating server state

Server APIs which perform mutations often require making POST requests with a request body specifying the new state or the change to be made.

The [`HttpClient.post()`](api/common/http/HttpClient#post) method behaves similarly to `get()`, and accepts an additional `body` argument before its options:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.post<Config>('/api/config', newConfig).subscribe(config => {
  console.log('Updated config:', config);
});
</docs-code>

Many different types of values can be provided as the request's `body`, and `HttpClient` will serialize them accordingly:

| **`body` type** | **Serialized as** |
| - | - |
| string | Plain text |
| number, boolean, array, or plain object | JSON |
| [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) | raw data from the buffer |
| [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) | raw data with the `Blob`'s content type |
| [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FormData) | `multipart/form-data` encoded data |
| [`HttpParams`](api/common/http/HttpParams) or [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` formatted string |

IMPORTANT: Remember to `.subscribe()` to mutation request `Observable`s in order to actually fire the request.

## Setting URL parameters

Specify request parameters that should be included in the request URL using the `params` option.

Passing an object literal is the simplest way of configuring URL parameters:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/api/config', {
  params: {filter: 'all'},
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

Alternatively, pass an instance of `HttpParams` if you need more control over the construction or serialization of the parameters.

IMPORTANT: Instances of `HttpParams` are _immutable_ and cannot be directly changed. Instead, mutation methods such as `append()` return a new instance of `HttpParams` with the mutation applied.

<docs-code language="ts">
const baseParams = new HttpParams().set('filter', 'all');

http.get('/api/config', {
  params: baseParams.set('details', 'enabled'),
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

You can instantiate `HttpParams` with a custom `HttpParameterCodec` that determines how `HttpClient` will encode the parameters into the URL.

## Setting request headers

Specify request headers that should be included in the request using the `headers` option.

Passing an object literal is the simplest way of configuring request headers:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get('/api/config', {
  headers: {
    'X-Debug-Level': 'verbose',
  }
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

Alternatively, pass an instance of `HttpHeaders` if you need more control over the construction of headers

IMPORTANT: Instances of `HttpHeaders` are _immutable_ and cannot be directly changed. Instead, mutation methods such as `append()` return a new instance of `HttpHeaders` with the mutation applied.

<docs-code language="ts">
const baseHeaders = new HttpHeaders().set('X-Debug-Level', 'minimal');

http.get<Config>('/api/config', {
  headers: baseHeaders.set('X-Debug-Level', 'verbose'),
}).subscribe(config => {
  // ...
});
</docs-code>

## Interacting with the server response events

For convenience, `HttpClient` by default returns an `Observable` of the data returned by the server (the response body). Occasionally it's desirable to examine the actual response, for example to retrieve specific response headers.

To access the entire response, set the `observe` option to `'response'`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.get<Config>('/api/config', {observe: 'response'}).subscribe(res => {
  console.log('Response status:', res.status);
  console.log('Body:', res.body);
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `observe`">
Because the value of `observe` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `observe: 'response' as const`.
</docs-callout>

## Receiving raw progress events

In addition to the response body or response object, `HttpClient` can also return a stream of raw _events_ corresponding to specific moments in the request lifecycle. These events include when the request is sent, when the response header is returned, and when the body is complete. These events can also include _progress events_ which report upload and download status for large request or response bodies.

Progress events are disabled by default (as they have a performance cost) but can be enabled with the `reportProgress` option.

NOTE: The optional `fetch` implementation of `HttpClient` does not report _upload_ progress events.

To observe the event stream, set the `observe` option to `'events'`:

<docs-code language="ts">
http.post('/api/upload', myData, {
  reportProgress: true,
  observe: 'events',
}).subscribe(event => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case HttpEventType.UploadProgress:
      console.log('Uploaded ' + event.loaded + ' out of ' + event.total + ' bytes');
      break;
    case HttpEventType.Response:
      console.log('Finished uploading!');
      break;
  }
});
</docs-code>

<docs-callout important title="Literal value for `observe`">
Because the value of `observe` affects the type returned by `HttpClient`, it must have a literal type and not a `string` type.

This happens automatically if the options object passed to the request method is a literal object, but if you're extracting the request options out into a variable or helper method you might need to explicitly specify it as a literal, such as `observe: 'events' as const`.
</docs-callout>

Each `HttpEvent` reported in the event stream has a `type` which distinguishes what the event represents:

| **`type` value** | **Event meaning** |
| - | - |
| `HttpEventType.Sent` | The request has been dispatched to the server |
| `HttpEventType.UploadProgress` | An `HttpUploadProgressEvent` reporting progress on uploading the request body |
| `HttpEventType.ResponseHeader` | The head of the response has been received, including status and headers |
| `HttpEventType.DownloadProgress` | An `HttpDownloadProgressEvent` reporting progress on downloading the response body |
| `HttpEventType.Response` | The entire response has been received, including the response body |
| `HttpEventType.User` | A custom event from an Http interceptor.

## Handling request failure

There are two ways an HTTP request can fail:

* A network or connection error can prevent the request from reaching the backend server.
* The backend can receive the request but fail to process it, and return an error response.

`HttpClient` captures both kinds of errors in an `HttpErrorResponse` which it returns through the `Observable`'s error channel. Network errors have a `status` code of `0` and an `error` which is an instance of [`ProgressEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ProgressEvent). Backend errors have the failing `status` code returned by the backend, and the error response as the `error`. Inspect the response to identify the error's cause and the appropriate action to handle the error.

The [RxJS library](https://rxjs.dev/) offers several operators which can be useful for error handling.

You can use the `catchError` operator to transform an error response into a value for the UI. This value can tell the UI to display an error page or value, and capture the error's cause if necessary.

Sometimes transient errors such as network interruptions can cause a request to fail unexpectedly, and simply retrying the request will allow it to succeed. RxJS provides several *retry* operators which automatically re-subscribe to a failed `Observable` under certain conditions. For example, the `retry()` operator will automatically attempt to re-subscribe a specified number of times.

## Http `Observable`s

Each request method on `HttpClient` constructs and returns an `Observable` of the requested response type. Understanding how these `Observable`s work is important when using `HttpClient`.

`HttpClient` produces what RxJS calls "cold" `Observable`s, meaning that no actual request happens until the `Observable` is subscribed. Only then is the request actually dispatched to the server. Subscribing to the same `Observable` multiple times will trigger multiple backend requests. Each subscription is independent.

TIP: You can think of `HttpClient` `Observable`s as _blueprints_ for actual server requests.

Once subscribed, unsubscribing will abort the in-progress request. This is very useful if the `Observable` is subscribed via the `async` pipe, as it will automatically cancel the request if the user navigates away from the current page. Additionally, if you use the `Observable` with an RxJS combinator like `switchMap`, this cancellation will clean up any stale requests.

Once the response returns, `Observable`s from `HttpClient` usually complete (although interceptors can influence this).

Because of the automatic completion, there is usually no risk of memory leaks if `HttpClient` subscriptions are not cleaned up. However, as with any async operation, we strongly recommend that you clean up subscriptions when the component using them is destroyed, as the subscription callback may otherwise run and encounter errors when it attempts to interact with the destroyed component.

TIP: Using the `async` pipe or the `toSignal` operation to subscribe to `Observable`s ensures that subscriptions are disposed properly.

## Best practices

While `HttpClient` can be injected and used directly from components, generally we recommend you create reusable, injectable services which isolate and encapsulate data access logic. For example, this `UserService` encapsulates the logic to request data for a user by their id:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class UserService {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);

  getUser(id: string): Observable<User> {
    return this.http.get<User>(`/api/user/${id}`);
  }
}
</docs-code>

Within a component, you can combine `@if` with the `async` pipe to render the UI for the data only after it's finished loading:

<docs-code language="ts">
import { AsyncPipe } from '@angular/common';
@Component({
  imports: [AsyncPipe],
  template: `
    @if (user$ | async; as user) {
      <p>Name: {{ user.name }}</p>
      <p>Biography: {{ user.biography }}</p>
    }
  `,
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
  @Input() userId!: string;
  user$!: Observable<User>;

  private userService = inject(UserService);

  constructor(): void {
    this.user$ = this.userService.getUser(this.userId);
  }
}
</docs-code>

# Understanding communicating with backend services using HTTP

Most front-end applications need to communicate with a server over the HTTP protocol, to download or upload data and access other back-end services. Angular provides a client HTTP API for Angular applications, the `HttpClient` service class in `@angular/common/http`.

## HTTP client service features

The HTTP client service offers the following major features:

* The ability to request [typed response values](guide/http/making-requests#fetching-json-data)
* Streamlined [error handling](guide/http/making-requests#handling-request-failure)
* Request and response [interception](guide/http/interceptors)
* Robust [testing utilities](guide/http/testing)

</docs-pill-row>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/http/security.md
================================================
# `HttpClient` security

`HttpClient` includes built-in support for two common HTTP security mechanisms: XSSI protection and XSRF/CSRF protection.

TIP: Also consider adopting a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) for your APIs.

## XSSI protection

Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) is a form of [Cross-Site Scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack where an attacker loads JSON data from your API endpoints as `<script>`s on a page they control. Different JavaScript techniques can then be used to access this data.

A common technique to prevent XSSI is to serve JSON responses with a "non-executable prefix", commonly `)]}',\n`. This prefix prevents the JSON response from being interpreted as valid executable JavaScript. When the API is loaded as data, the prefix can be stripped before JSON parsing.

`HttpClient` automatically strips this XSSI prefix (if present) when parsing JSON from a response.

## XSRF/CSRF protection

[Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF or CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is an attack technique by which the attacker can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly executing actions on your website.

`HttpClient` supports a [common mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Cookie-to-header_token) used to prevent XSRF attacks. When performing HTTP requests, an interceptor reads a token from a cookie, by default `XSRF-TOKEN`, and sets it as an HTTP header, `X-XSRF-TOKEN`. Because only code that runs on your domain could read the cookie, the backend can be certain that the HTTP request came from your client application and not an attacker.

By default, an interceptor sends this header on all mutating requests (such as `POST`) to relative URLs, but not on GET/HEAD requests or on requests with an absolute URL.

<docs-callout helpful title="Why not protect GET requests?">
CSRF protection is only needed for requests that can change state on the backend. By their nature, CSRF attacks cross domain boundaries, and the web's [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) will prevent an attacking page from retrieving the results of authenticated GET requests.
</docs-callout>

To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on either the page load or the first GET request. On subsequent requests the server can verify that the cookie matches the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure that only code running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server; this prevents the client from making up its own tokens. Set the token to a digest of your site's authentication cookie with a salt for added security.

To prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the same domain or subdomain, give each application a unique cookie name.

<docs-callout important title="HttpClient supports only the client half of the XSRF protection scheme">
  Your backend service must be configured to set the cookie for your page, and to verify that the header is present on all eligible requests. Failing to do so renders Angular's default protection ineffective.
</docs-callout>

### Configure custom cookie/header names

If your backend service uses different names for the XSRF token cookie or header, use `withXsrfConfiguration` to override the defaults.

Add it to the `provideHttpClient` call as follows:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withXsrfConfiguration({
        cookieName: 'CUSTOM_XSRF_TOKEN',
        headerName: 'X-Custom-Xsrf-Header',
      }),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

### Disabling XSRF protection

If the built-in XSRF protection mechanism doesn't work for your application, you can disable it using the `withNoXsrfProtection` feature:

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withNoXsrfProtection(),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/http/setup.md
================================================
# Setting up `HttpClient`

Before you can use `HttpClient` in your app, you must configure it using [dependency injection](guide/di).

## Providing `HttpClient` through dependency injection

`HttpClient` is provided using the `provideHttpClient` helper function, which most apps include in the application `providers` in `app.config.ts`.

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

If your app is using NgModule-based bootstrap instead, you can include `provideHttpClient` in the providers of your app's NgModule:

<docs-code language="ts">
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
  ],
  // ... other application configuration
})
export class AppModule {}
</docs-code>

You can then inject the `HttpClient` service as a dependency of your components, services, or other classes:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class ConfigService {
  private http = inject(HttpClient);
  // This service can now make HTTP requests via `this.http`.
}
</docs-code>

## Configuring features of `HttpClient`

`provideHttpClient` accepts a list of optional feature configurations, to enable or configure the behavior of different aspects of the client. This section details the optional features and their usages.

### `withFetch`

<docs-code language="ts">
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(
      withFetch(),
    ),
  ]
};
</docs-code>

By default, `HttpClient` uses the [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) API to make requests. The `withFetch` feature switches the client to use the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API instead.

`fetch` is a more modern API and is available in a few environments where `XMLHttpRequest` is not supported. It does have a few limitations, such as not producing upload progress events.

### `withInterceptors(...)`

`withInterceptors` configures the set of interceptor functions which will process requests made through `HttpClient`. See the [interceptor guide](guide/http/interceptors) for more information.

### `withInterceptorsFromDi()`

`withInterceptorsFromDi` includes the older style of class-based interceptors in the `HttpClient` configuration. See the [interceptor guide](guide/http/interceptors) for more information.

HELPFUL: Functional interceptors (through `withInterceptors`) have more predictable ordering and we recommend them over DI-based interceptors.

### `withRequestsMadeViaParent()`

By default, when you configure `HttpClient` using `provideHttpClient` within a given injector, this configuration overrides any configuration for `HttpClient` which may be present in the parent injector.

When you add `withRequestsMadeViaParent()`, `HttpClient` is configured to instead pass requests up to the `HttpClient` instance in the parent injector, once they've passed through any configured interceptors at this level. This is useful if you want to _add_ interceptors in a child injector, while still sending the request through the parent injector's interceptors as well.

CRITICAL: You must configure an instance of `HttpClient` above the current injector, or this option is not valid and you'll get a runtime error when you try to use it.

### `withJsonpSupport()`

Including `withJsonpSupport` enables the `.jsonp()` method on `HttpClient`, which makes a GET request via the [JSONP convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for cross-domain loading of data.

HELPFUL: Prefer using [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to make cross-domain requests instead of JSONP when possible.

### `withXsrfConfiguration(...)`

Including this option allows for customization of `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](best-practices/security) for more information.

### `withNoXsrfProtection()`

Including this option disables `HttpClient`'s built-in XSRF security functionality. See the [security guide](best-practices/security) for more information.

## `HttpClientModule`-based configuration

Some applications may configure `HttpClient` using the older API based on NgModules.

This table lists the NgModules available from `@angular/common/http` and how they relate to the provider configuration functions above.

| **NgModule**                            | `provideHttpClient()` equivalent              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `HttpClientModule`                      | `provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())` |
| `HttpClientJsonpModule`                 | `withJsonpSupport()`                          |
| `HttpClientXsrfModule.withOptions(...)` | `withXsrfConfiguration(...)`                  |
| `HttpClientXsrfModule.disable()`        | `withNoXsrfProtection()`                      |

<docs-callout important title="Use caution when using HttpClientModule in multiple injectors">
When `HttpClientModule` is present in multiple injectors, the behavior of interceptors is poorly defined and depends on the exact options and provider/import ordering.

Prefer `provideHttpClient` for multi-injector configurations, as it has more stable behavior. See the `withRequestsMadeViaParent` feature above.
</docs-callout>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/http/testing.md
================================================
# Test requests

As for any external dependency, you must mock the HTTP backend so your tests can simulate interaction with a remote server. The `@angular/common/http/testing` library provides tools to capture requests made by the application, make assertions about them, and mock the responses to emulate your backend's behavior.

The testing library is designed for a pattern in which the app executes code and makes requests first. The test then expects that certain requests have or have not been made, performs assertions against those requests, and finally provides responses by "flushing" each expected request.

At the end, tests can verify that the app made no unexpected requests.

## Setup for testing

To begin testing usage of `HttpClient`, configure `TestBed` and include `provideHttpClient()` and `provideHttpClientTesting()` in your test's setup. This configures `HttpClient` to use a test backend instead of the real network. It also provides `HttpTestingController`, which you'll use to interact with the test backend, set expectations about which requests have been made, and flush responses to those requests. `HttpTestingController` can be injected from `TestBed` once configured.

Keep in mind to provide `provideHttpClient()` **before** `provideHttpClientTesting()`, as `provideHttpClientTesting()` will overwrite parts of `provideHttpCient()`. Doing it the other way around can potentially break your tests.

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    // ... other test providers
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});

const httpTesting = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);
</docs-code>

Now when your tests make requests, they will hit the testing backend instead of the normal one. You can use `httpTesting` to make assertions about those requests.

## Expecting and answering requests

For example, you can write a test that expects a GET request to occur and provides a mock response:

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    ConfigService,
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});

const httpTesting = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);

// Load `ConfigService` and request the current configuration.
const service = TestBed.inject(ConfigService);
const config$ = this.configService.getConfig<Config>();

// `firstValueFrom` subscribes to the `Observable`, which makes the HTTP request,
// and creates a `Promise` of the response.
const configPromise = firstValueFrom(config$);

// At this point, the request is pending, and we can assert it was made
// via the `HttpTestingController`:
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config', 'Request to load the configuration');

// We can assert various properties of the request if desired.
expect(req.request.method).toBe('GET');

// Flushing the request causes it to complete, delivering the result.
req.flush(DEFAULT_CONFIG);

// We can then assert that the response was successfully delivered by the `ConfigService`:
expect(await configPromise).toEqual(DEFAULT_CONFIG);

// Finally, we can assert that no other requests were made.
httpTesting.verify();
</docs-code>

NOTE: `expectOne` will fail if the test has made more than one request which matches the given criteria.

As an alternative to asserting on `req.method`, you could instead use an expanded form of `expectOne` to also match the request method:

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne({
  method: 'GET',
  url: '/api/config',
}, 'Request to load the configuration');
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: The expectation APIs match against the full URL of requests, including any query parameters.

The last step, verifying that no requests remain outstanding, is common enough for you to move it into an `afterEach()` step:

<docs-code language="ts">
afterEach(() => {
  // Verify that none of the tests make any extra HTTP requests.
  TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController).verify();
});
</docs-code>

## Handling more than one request at once

If you need to respond to duplicate requests in your test, use the `match()` API instead of `expectOne()`. It takes the same arguments but returns an array of matching requests. Once returned, these requests are removed from future matching and you are responsible for flushing and verifying them.

<docs-code language="ts">
const allGetRequests = httpTesting.match({method: 'GET'});
for (const req of allGetRequests) {
  // Handle responding to each request.
}
</docs-code>

## Advanced matching

All matching functions accept a predicate function for custom matching logic:

<docs-code language="ts">
// Look for one request that has a request body.
const requestsWithBody = httpTesting.expectOne(req => req.body !== null);
</docs-code>

The `expectNone` function asserts that no requests match the given criteria.

<docs-code language="ts">
// Assert that no mutation requests have been issued.
httpTesting.expectNone(req => req.method !== 'GET');
</docs-code>

## Testing error handling

You should test your app's responses when HTTP requests fail.

### Backend errors

To test handling of backend errors (when the server returns a non-successful status code), flush requests with an error response that emulates what your backend would return when a request fails.

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');
req.flush('Failed!', {status: 500, statusText: 'Internal Server Error'});

// Assert that the application successfully handled the backend error.
</docs-code>

### Network errors

Requests can also fail due to network errors, which surface as `ProgressEvent` errors. These can be delivered with the `error()` method:

<docs-code language="ts">
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');
req.error(new ProgressEvent('network error!'));

// Assert that the application successfully handled the network error.
</docs-code>

## Testing an Interceptor

You should test that your interceptors work under the desired circumstances.

For example, an application may be required to add an authentication token generated by a service to each outgoing request.
This behavior can be enforced with the use of an interceptor:

<docs-code language="ts">
export function authInterceptor(request: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandlerFn): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);

  const clonedRequest = request.clone({
    headers: request.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', authService.getAuthToken()),
  });
  return next(clonedRequest);
}
</docs-code>

The `TestBed` configuration for this interceptor should rely on the `withInterceptors` feature.

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    // Testing one interceptor at a time is recommended.
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([authInterceptor])),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
  ],
});
</docs-code>

The `HttpTestingController` can retrieve the request instance which can then be inspected to ensure that the request was modified.

<docs-code language="ts">
const service = TestBed.inject(AuthService);
const req = httpTesting.expectOne('/api/config');

expect(req.request.headers.get('X-Authentication-Token')).toEqual(service.getAuthToken());
</docs-code>

A similar interceptor could be implemented with class based interceptors:

<docs-code language="ts">
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  private authService = inject(AuthService);

  intercept(request: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
    const clonedRequest = request.clone({
      headers: request.headers.append('X-Authentication-Token', this.authService.getAuthToken()),
    });
    return next.handle(clonedRequest);
  }
}
</docs-code>

In order to test it, the `TestBed` configuration should instead be:

<docs-code language="ts">
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    AuthService,
    provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()),
    provideHttpClientTesting(),
    // We rely on the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token to register the AuthInterceptor as an HttpInterceptor
    { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true },
  ],
});
</docs-code>

# Add the localize package

To take advantage of the localization features of Angular, use the [Angular CLI][CliMain] to add the `@angular/localize` package to your project.

To add the `@angular/localize` package, use the following command to update the `package.json` and TypeScript configuration files in your project.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="add-localize"/>

It adds `types: ["@angular/localize"]` in the TypeScript configuration files.
It also adds line `/// <reference types="@angular/localize" />` at the top of the `main.ts` file which is the reference to the type definition.

HELPFUL: For more information about `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files, see [Workspace npm dependencies][GuideNpmPackages] and [TypeScript Configuration][GuideTsConfig]. To learn about Triple-slash Directives visit [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#-reference-types-).

If `@angular/localize` is not installed and you try to build a localized version of your project (for example, while using the `i18n` attributes in templates), the [Angular CLI][CliMain] will generate an error, which would contain the steps that you can take to enable i18n for your project.

## Options

| OPTION           | DESCRIPTION | VALUE TYPE | DEFAULT VALUE
|:---              |:---    |:------     |:------
| `--project`      | The name of the project. | `string` |
| `--use-at-runtime` | If set, then `$localize` can be used at runtime. Also `@angular/localize` gets included in the `dependencies` section of `package.json`, rather than `devDependencies`, which is the default.  | `boolean` | `false`

For more available options, see `ng add` in [Angular CLI][CliMain].

# Deploy multiple locales

If `myapp` is the directory that contains the distributable files of your project, you typically make different versions available for different locales in locale directories.
For example, your French version is located in the `myapp/fr` directory and the Spanish version is located in the `myapp/es` directory.

The HTML `base` tag with the `href` attribute specifies the base URI, or URL, for relative links.
If you set the `"localize"` option in [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file to `true` or to an array of locale IDs, the CLI adjusts the base `href` for each version of the application.
To adjust the base `href` for each version of the application, the CLI adds the locale to the configured `"subPath"`.
Specify the `"subPath"` for each locale in your [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file.
The following example displays `"subPath"` set to an empty string.

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="i18n-subPath"/>

## Configure a server

Typical deployment of multiple languages serve each language from a different subdirectory.
Users are redirected to the preferred language defined in the browser using the `Accept-Language` HTTP header.
If the user has not defined a preferred language, or if the preferred language is not available, then the server falls back to the default language.
To change the language, change your current location to another subdirectory.
The change of subdirectory often occurs using a menu implemented in the application.

For more information on how to deploy apps to a remote server, see [Deployment][GuideDeployment].

IMPORTANT: If you are using [Server rendering](guide/ssr) with `outputMode` set to `server`, Angular automatically handles redirection dynamically based on the `Accept-Language` HTTP header. This simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for manual server or configuration adjustments.

# Format data based on locale

Angular provides the following built-in data transformation [pipes](guide/templates/pipes).
The data transformation pipes use the [`LOCALE_ID`][ApiCoreLocaleId] token to format data based on rules of each locale.

| Data transformation pipe                   | Details |
|:---                                        |:---     |
| [`DatePipe`][ApiCommonDatepipe]         | Formats a date value.                             |
| [`CurrencyPipe`][ApiCommonCurrencypipe] | Transforms a number into a currency string.       |
| [`DecimalPipe`][ApiCommonDecimalpipe]   | Transforms a number into a decimal number string. |
| [`PercentPipe`][ApiCommonPercentpipe]   | Transforms a number into a percentage string.     |

## Use DatePipe to display the current date

To display the current date in the format for the current locale, use the following format for the `DatePipe`.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

{{ today | date }}

</docs-code>

## Override current locale for CurrencyPipe

Add the `locale` parameter to the pipe to override the current value of `LOCALE_ID` token.

To force the currency to use American English \(`en-US`\), use the following format for the `CurrencyPipe`

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

{{ amount | currency : 'en-US' }}

</docs-code>

HELPFUL: The locale specified for the `CurrencyPipe` overrides the global `LOCALE_ID` token of your application.

# Import global variants of the locale data

The [Angular CLI][CliMain] automatically includes locale data if you run the [`ng build`][CliBuild] command with the `--localize` option.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="shell">

ng build --localize

</docs-code>

HELPFUL: The initial installation of Angular already contains locale data for English in the United States \(`en-US`\).
The [Angular CLI][CliMain] automatically includes the locale data and sets the `LOCALE_ID` value when you use the `--localize` option with [`ng build`][CliBuild] command.

The `@angular/common` package on npm contains the locale data files.
Global variants of the locale data are available in `@angular/common/locales/global`.

## `import` example for French

For example, you could import the global variants for French \(`fr`\) in `main.ts` where you bootstrap the application.

<docs-code header="src/main.ts (import locale)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/main.ts" visibleRegion="global-locale"/>

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/i18n/locale-id.md
================================================
# Refer to locales by ID

Angular uses the Unicode *locale identifier* \(Unicode locale ID\) to find the correct locale data for internationalization of text strings.

<docs-callout title="Unicode locale ID">

* A locale ID conforms to the [Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) core specification][UnicodeCldrDevelopmentCoreSpecification].
    For more information about locale IDs, see [Unicode Language and Locale Identifiers][UnicodeCldrDevelopmentCoreSpecificationLocaleIDs].

* CLDR and Angular use [BCP 47 tags][RfcEditorInfoBcp47] as the base for the locale ID

</docs-callout>

A locale ID specifies the language, country, and an optional code for further variants or subdivisions.
A locale ID consists of the language identifier, a hyphen \(`-`\) character, and the locale extension.

<docs-code language="html">
{language_id}-{locale_extension}
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: To accurately translate your Angular project, you must decide which languages and locales you are targeting for internationalization.

Many countries share the same language, but differ in usage.
The differences include grammar, punctuation, formats for currency, decimal numbers, dates, and so on.

For the examples in this guide, use the following languages and locales.

| Language | Locale                   | Unicode locale ID |
|:---      |:---                      |:---               |
| English  | Canada                   | `en-CA`           |
| English  | United States of America | `en-US`           |
| French   | Canada                   | `fr-CA`           |
| French   | France                   | `fr-FR`           |

The [Angular repository][GithubAngularAngularTreeMasterPackagesCommonLocales] includes common locales.

<docs-callout>
For a list of language codes, see [ISO 639-2](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2).
</docs-callout>

## Set the source locale ID

Use the Angular CLI to set the source language in which you are writing the component template and code.

By default, Angular uses `en-US` as the source locale of your project.

To change the source locale of your project for the build, complete the following actions.

1. Open the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file.
2. Add or modify the `sourceLocale` field inside the `i18n` section:
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project": {
      "i18n": {
        "sourceLocale": "ca"  // Use your desired locale code
      }
    }
  }
}

================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/i18n/manage-marked-text.md
================================================
# Manage marked text with custom IDs

The Angular extractor generates a file with a translation unit entry each of the following instances.

* Each `i18n` attribute in a component template
* Each [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string in component code

As described in [How meanings control text extraction and merges][GuideI18nCommonPrepareHowMeaningsControlTextExtractionAndMerges], Angular assigns each translation unit a unique ID.

The following example displays translation units with unique IDs.

<docs-code header="messages.fr.xlf.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="generated-id"/>

When you change the translatable text, the extractor generates a new ID for that translation unit.
In most cases, changes in the source text also require a change to the translation.
Therefore, using a new ID keeps the text change in sync with translations.

However, some translation systems require a specific form or syntax for the ID.
To address the requirement, use a custom ID to mark text.
Most developers don't need to use a custom ID.
If you want to use a unique syntax to convey additional metadata, use a custom ID.
Additional metadata may include the library, component, or area of the application in which the text appears.

To specify a custom ID in the `i18n` attribute or [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string, use the `@@` prefix.
The following example defines the `introductionHeader` custom ID in a heading element.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute-solo-id"/>

The following example defines the `introductionHeader` custom ID for a variable.

<!--todo: replace with code example -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

variableText1 = $localize`:@@introductionHeader:Hello i18n!`;

</docs-code>

When you specify a custom ID, the extractor generates a translation unit with the custom ID.

<docs-code header="messages.fr.xlf.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="custom-id"/>

If you change the text, the extractor does not change the ID.
As a result, you don't have to take the extra step to update the translation.
The drawback of using custom IDs is that if you change the text, your translation may be out-of-sync with the newly changed source text.

## Use a custom ID with a description

Use a custom ID in combination with a description and a meaning to further help the translator.

The following example includes a description, followed by the custom ID.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute-id"/>

The following example defines the `introductionHeader` custom ID and description for a variable.

<!--todo: replace with code example -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

variableText2 = $localize`:An introduction header for this sample@@introductionHeader:Hello i18n!`;

</docs-code>

The following example adds a meaning.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute-meaning-and-id"/>

The following example defines the `introductionHeader` custom ID for a variable.

<!--todo: replace with code example -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

variableText3 = $localize`:site header|An introduction header for this sample@@introductionHeader:Hello i18n!`;

</docs-code>

### Define unique custom IDs

Be sure to define custom IDs that are unique.
If you use the same ID for two different text elements, the extraction tool extracts only the first one, and Angular uses the translation in place of both original text elements.

For example, in the following code snippet the same `myId` custom ID is defined for two different text elements.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-duplicate-custom-id"/>

The following displays the translation in French.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="i18n-duplicate-custom-id"/>

Both elements now use the same translation \(`Bonjour`\), because both were defined with the same custom ID.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/rendered-output.html"/>

================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/i18n/merge.md
================================================
# Merge translations into the application

To merge the completed translations into your project, complete the following actions

1. Use the [Angular CLI][CliMain] to build a copy of the distributable files of your project
1. Use the `"localize"` option to replace all of the i18n messages with the valid translations and build a localized variant application.
    A variant application is a complete a copy of the distributable files of your application translated for a single locale.

After you merge the translations, serve each distributable copy of the application using server-side language detection or different subdirectories.

HELPFUL: For more information about how to serve each distributable copy of the application, see [deploying multiple locales](guide/i18n/deploy).

For a compile-time translation of the application, the build process uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to produce a small, fast, ready-to-run application.

HELPFUL: For a detailed explanation of the build process, see [Building and serving Angular apps][GuideBuild].
The build process works for translation files in the `.xlf` format or in another format that Angular understands, such as `.xtb`.
For more information about translation file formats used by Angular, see [Change the source language file format][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesChangeTheSourceLanguageFileFormat]

To build a separate distributable copy of the application for each locale, [define the locales in the build configuration][GuideI18nCommonMergeDefineLocalesInTheBuildConfiguration] in the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file of your project.

This method shortens the build process by removing the requirement to perform a full application build for each locale.

To [generate application variants for each locale][GuideI18nCommonMergeGenerateApplicationVariantsForEachLocale], use the `"localize"` option in the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file.
Also, to [build from the command line][GuideI18nCommonMergeBuildFromTheCommandLine], use the [`build`][CliBuild] [Angular CLI][CliMain] command with the `--localize` option.

HELPFUL: Optionally, [apply specific build options for just one locale][GuideI18nCommonMergeApplySpecificBuildOptionsForJustOneLocale] for a custom locale configuration.

## Define locales in the build configuration

Use the `i18n` project option in the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file of your project to define locales for a project.

The following sub-options identify the source language and tell the compiler where to find supported translations for the project.

| Suboption      | Details |
|:---            |:--- |
| `sourceLocale` | The locale you use within the application source code \(`en-US` by default\) |
| `locales`      | A map of locale identifiers to translation files                             |

### `angular.json` for `en-US` and `fr` example

For example, the following excerpt of an [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file sets the source locale to `en-US` and provides the path to the French \(`fr`\) locale translation file.

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="locale-config"/>

## Generate application variants for each locale

To use your locale definition in the build configuration, use the `"localize"` option in the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file to tell the CLI which locales to generate for the build configuration.

* Set `"localize"` to `true` for all the locales previously defined in the build configuration.
* Set `"localize"` to an array of a subset of the previously defined locale identifiers to build only those locale versions.
* Set `"localize"` to `false` to disable localization and not generate any locale-specific versions.

HELPFUL: Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation is required to localize component templates.

If you changed this setting, set `"aot"` to `true` in order to use AOT.

HELPFUL: Due to the deployment complexities of i18n and the need to minimize rebuild time, the development server only supports localizing a single locale at a time.
If you set the `"localize"` option to `true`, define more than one locale, and use `ng serve`; then an error occurs.
If you want to develop against a specific locale, set the `"localize"` option to a specific locale.
For example, for French \(`fr`\), specify `"localize": ["fr"]`.

The CLI loads and registers the locale data, places each generated version in a locale-specific directory to keep it separate from other locale versions, and puts the directories within the configured `outputPath` for the project.
For each application variant the `lang` attribute of the `html` element is set to the locale.
The CLI also adjusts the HTML base HREF for each version of the application by adding the locale to the configured `baseHref`.

Set the `"localize"` property as a shared configuration to effectively inherit for all the configurations.
Also, set the property to override other configurations.

### `angular.json` include all locales from build example

The following example displays the `"localize"` option set to `true` in the [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file, so that all locales defined in the build configuration are built.

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="build-localize-true"/>

## Build from the command line

Also, use the `--localize` option with the [`ng build`][CliBuild] command and your existing `production` configuration.
The CLI builds all locales defined in the build configuration.
If you set the locales in build configuration, it is similar to when you set the `"localize"` option to `true`.

HELPFUL: For more information about how to set the locales, see [Generate application variants for each locale][GuideI18nCommonMergeGenerateApplicationVariantsForEachLocale].

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="build-localize"/>

## Apply specific build options for just one locale

To apply specific build options to only one locale, specify a single locale to create a custom locale-specific configuration.

IMPORTANT: Use the [Angular CLI][CliMain] development server \(`ng serve`\) with only a single locale.

### build for French example

The following example displays a custom locale-specific configuration using a single locale.

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="build-single-locale"/>

Pass this configuration to the `ng serve` or `ng build` commands.
The following code example displays how to serve the French language file.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="serve-french"/>

For production builds, use configuration composition to run both configurations.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="build-production-french"/>

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="build-production-french" />

## Report missing translations

When a translation is missing, the build succeeds but generates a warning such as `Missing translation for message "{translation_text}"`.
To configure the level of warning that is generated by the Angular compiler, specify one of the following levels.

| Warning level | Details                                              | Output |
|:---           |:---                                                  |:---    |
| `error`       | Throw an error and the build fails                   | n/a                                                    |
| `ignore`      | Do nothing                                           | n/a                                                    |
| `warning`     | Displays the default warning in the console or shell | `Missing translation for message "{translation_text}"` |

Specify the warning level in the `options` section for the `build` target of your [`angular.json`][GuideWorkspaceConfig] workspace build configuration file.

### `angular.json` `error` warning example

The following example displays how to set the warning level to `error`.

<docs-code header="angular.json" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/angular.json" visibleRegion="missing-translation-error" />

HELPFUL: When you compile your Angular project into an Angular application, the instances of the `i18n` attribute are replaced with instances of the [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string.
This means that your Angular application is translated after compilation.
This also means that you can create localized versions of your Angular application without re-compiling your entire Angular project for each locale.

When you translate your Angular application, the *translation transformation* replaces and reorders the parts \(static strings and expressions\) of the template literal string with strings from a collection of translations.
For more information, see [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize].

TLDR: Compile once, then translate for each locale.

# Angular Internationalization

*Internationalization*, sometimes referenced as i18n, is the process of designing and preparing your project for use in different locales around the world.
*Localization* is the process of building versions of your project for different locales.
The localization process includes the following actions.

* Extract text for translation into different languages
* Format data for a specific locale

A *locale* identifies a region in which people speak a particular language or language variant.
Possible regions include countries and geographical regions.
A locale determines the formatting and parsing of the following details.

* Measurement units including date and time, numbers, and currencies
* Translated names including time zones, languages, and countries

For a quick introduction to localization and internationalization watch this video:

================================================
# Prepare component for translation

To prepare your project for translation, complete the following actions.

- Use the `i18n` attribute to mark text in component templates
- Use the `i18n-` attribute to mark attribute text strings in component templates
- Use the `$localize` tagged message string to mark text strings in component code

## Mark text in component template

In a component template, the i18n metadata is the value of the `i18n` attribute.

<docs-code language="html">
<element i18n="{i18n_metadata}">{string_to_translate}</element>
</docs-code>

Use the `i18n` attribute to mark a static text message in your component templates for translation.
Place it on every element tag that contains fixed text you want to translate.

HELPFUL: The `i18n` attribute is a custom attribute that the Angular tools and compilers recognize.

### `i18n` example

The following `<h1>` tag displays a simple English language greeting, "Hello i18n!".

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="greeting"/>

To mark the greeting for translation, add the `i18n` attribute to the `<h1>` tag.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute"/>


### using conditional statement with `i18n`

The following `<div>` tag will display translated text as part of `div` and `aria-label` based on toggle status 

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html"  visibleRegion="i18n-conditional"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.ts" visibleLines="[[14,21],[33,37]]"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

### Translate inline text without HTML element

Use the `<ng-container>` element to associate a translation behavior for specific text without changing the way text is displayed.

HELPFUL: Each HTML element creates a new DOM element.
To avoid creating a new DOM element, wrap the text in an `<ng-container>` element.
The following example shows the `<ng-container>` element transformed into a non-displayed HTML comment.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-ng-container"/>

## Mark element attributes for translations

In a component template, the i18n metadata is the value of the `i18n-{attribute_name}` attribute.

<docs-code language="html">
<element i18n-{attribute_name}="{i18n_metadata}" {attribute_name}="{attribute_value}" />
</docs-code>

The attributes of HTML elements include text that should be translated along with the rest of the displayed text in the component template.

Use `i18n-{attribute_name}` with any attribute of any element and replace `{attribute_name}` with the name of the attribute.
Use the following syntax to assign a meaning, description, and custom ID.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">
i18n-{attribute_name}="{meaning}|{description}@@{id}"
</docs-code>

### `i18n-title` example

To translate the title of an image, review this example.
The following example displays an image with a `title` attribute.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-title"/>

To mark the title attribute for translation, complete the following action.

1. Add the `i18n-title` attribute

   The following example displays how to mark the `title` attribute on the `img` tag by adding `i18n-title`.

   <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-title-translate"/>

## Mark text in component code

In component code, the translation source text and the metadata are surrounded by backtick \(<code>&#96;</code>\) characters.

Use the [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string to mark a string in your code for translation.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">
$localize`string_to_translate`;
</docs-code>

The i18n metadata is surrounded by colon \(`:`\) characters and prepends the translation source text.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">
$localize`:{i18n_metadata}:string_to_translate`
</docs-code>

### Include interpolated text

Include [interpolations](guide/templates/binding#render-dynamic-text-with-text-interpolation) in a [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">
$localize`string_to_translate ${variable_name}`;
</docs-code>

### Name the interpolation placeholder

<docs-code language="typescript">
$localize`string_to_translate ${variable_name}:placeholder_name:`;
</docs-code>

### Conditional syntax for translations

<docs-code language="typescript">
return this.show ? $localize`Show Tabs` : $localize`Hide tabs`;
</docs-code>



## i18n metadata for translation

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">
{meaning}|{description}@@{custom_id}
</docs-code>

The following parameters provide context and additional information to reduce confusion for your translator.

| Metadata parameter | Details                                                               |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Custom ID          | Provide a custom identifier                                           |
| Description        | Provide additional information or context                             |
| Meaning            | Provide the meaning or intent of the text within the specific context |

For additional information about custom IDs, see [Manage marked text with custom IDs][GuideI18nOptionalManageMarkedText].

### Add helpful descriptions and meanings

To translate a text message accurately, provide additional information or context for the translator.

Add a _description_ of the text message as the value of the `i18n` attribute or [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string.

The following example shows the value of the `i18n` attribute.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute-desc"/>

The following example shows the value of the [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string with a description.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

$localize`:An introduction header for this sample:Hello i18n!`;

</docs-code>

The translator may also need to know the meaning or intent of the text message within this particular application context, in order to translate it the same way as other text with the same meaning.
Start the `i18n` attribute value with the _meaning_ and separate it from the _description_ with the `|` character: `{meaning}|{description}`.

#### `h1` example

For example, you may want to specify that the `<h1>` tag is a site header that you need translated the same way, whether it is used as a header or referenced in another section of text.

The following example shows how to specify that the `<h1>` tag must be translated as a header or referenced elsewhere.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-attribute-meaning"/>

The result is any text marked with `site header`, as the _meaning_ is translated exactly the same way.

The following code example shows the value of the [`$localize`][ApiLocalizeInitLocalize] tagged message string with a meaning and a description.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="typescript">

$localize`:site header|An introduction header for this sample:Hello i18n!`;

</docs-code>

<docs-callout title="How meanings control text extraction and merges">

The Angular extraction tool generates a translation unit entry for each `i18n` attribute in a template.
The Angular extraction tool assigns each translation unit a unique ID based on the _meaning_ and _description_.

HELPFUL: For more information about the Angular extraction tool, see [Work with translation files](guide/i18n/translation-files).

The same text elements with different _meanings_ are extracted with different IDs.
For example, if the word "right" uses the following two definitions in two different locations, the word is translated differently and merged back into the application as different translation entries.

- `correct` as in "you are right"
- `direction` as in "turn right"

If the same text elements meet the following conditions, the text elements are extracted only once and use the same ID.

- Same meaning or definition
- Different descriptions

That one translation entry is merged back into the application wherever the same text elements appear.

</docs-callout>

## ICU expressions

ICU expressions help you mark alternate text in component templates to meet conditions.
An ICU expression includes a component property, an ICU clause, and the case statements surrounded by open curly brace \(`{`\) and close curly brace \(`}`\) characters.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

{ component_property, icu_clause, case_statements }

</docs-code>

The component property defines the variable
An ICU clause defines the type of conditional text.

| ICU clause                                                           | Details                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`plural`][GuideI18nCommonPrepareMarkPlurals]                        | Mark the use of plural numbers                                      |
| [`select`][GuideI18nCommonPrepareMarkAlternatesAndNestedExpressions] | Mark choices for alternate text based on your defined string values |

To simplify translation, use International Components for Unicode clauses \(ICU clauses\) with regular expressions.

HELPFUL: The ICU clauses adhere to the [ICU Message Format][GithubUnicodeOrgIcuUserguideFormatParseMessages] specified in the [CLDR pluralization rules][UnicodeCldrIndexCldrSpecPluralRules].

### Mark plurals

Different languages have different pluralization rules that increase the difficulty of translation.
Because other locales express cardinality differently, you may need to set pluralization categories that do not align with English.
Use the `plural` clause to mark expressions that may not be meaningful if translated word-for-word.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

{ component_property, plural, pluralization_categories }

</docs-code>

After the pluralization category, enter the default text \(English\) surrounded by open curly brace \(`{`\) and close curly brace \(`}`\) characters.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

pluralization_category { }

</docs-code>

The following pluralization categories are available for English and may change based on the locale.

| Pluralization category | Details                    | Example                    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `zero`                 | Quantity is zero           | `=0 { }` <br /> `zero { }` |
| `one`                  | Quantity is 1              | `=1 { }` <br /> `one { }`  |
| `two`                  | Quantity is 2              | `=2 { }` <br /> `two { }`  |
| `few`                  | Quantity is 2 or more      | `few { }`                  |
| `many`                 | Quantity is a large number | `many { }`                 |
| `other`                | The default quantity       | `other { }`                |

If none of the pluralization categories match, Angular uses `other` to match the standard fallback for a missing category.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

other { default_quantity }

</docs-code>

HELPFUL: For more information about pluralization categories, see [Choosing plural category names][UnicodeCldrIndexCldrSpecPluralRulesTocChoosingPluralCategoryNames] in the [CLDR - Unicode Common Locale Data Repository][UnicodeCldrMain].

<docs-callout header='Background: Locales may not support some pluralization categories'>

Many locales don't support some of the pluralization categories.
The default locale \(`en-US`\) uses a very simple `plural()` function that doesn't support the `few` pluralization category.
Another locale with a simple `plural()` function is `es`.
The following code example shows the [en-US `plural()`][GithubAngularAngularBlobEcffc3557fe1bff9718c01277498e877ca44588dPackagesCoreSrcI18nLocaleEnTsL14L18] function.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/locale_plural_function.ts" class="no-box" hideCopy/>

The `plural()` function only returns 1 \(`one`\) or 5 \(`other`\).
The `few` category never matches.

</docs-callout>

#### `minutes` example

If you want to display the following phrase in English, where `x` is a number.

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

updated x minutes ago

</docs-code>

And you also want to display the following phrases based on the cardinality of `x`.

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

updated just now

</docs-code>

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

updated one minute ago

</docs-code>

Use HTML markup and [interpolations](guide/templates/binding#render-dynamic-text-with-text-interpolation).
The following code example shows how to use the `plural` clause to express the previous three situations in a `<span>` element.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-plural"/>

Review the following details in the previous code example.

| Parameters                        | Details                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minutes`                         | The first parameter specifies the component property is `minutes` and determines the number of minutes.               |
| `plural`                          | The second parameter specifies the ICU clause is `plural`.                                                            |
| `=0 {just now}`                   | For zero minutes, the pluralization category is `=0`. The value is `just now`.                                        |
| `=1 {one minute}`                 | For one minute, the pluralization category is `=1`. The value is `one minute`.                                        |
| `other {{{minutes}} minutes ago}` | For any unmatched cardinality, the default pluralization category is `other`. The value is `{{minutes}} minutes ago`. |

`{{minutes}}` is an [interpolation](guide/templates/binding#render-dynamic-text-with-text-interpolation).

### Mark alternates and nested expressions

The `select` clause marks choices for alternate text based on your defined string values.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

{ component_property, select, selection_categories }

</docs-code>

Translate all of the alternates to display alternate text based on the value of a variable.

After the selection category, enter the text \(English\) surrounded by open curly brace \(`{`\) and close curly brace \(`}`\) characters.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

selection_category { text }

</docs-code>

Different locales have different grammatical constructions that increase the difficulty of translation.
Use HTML markup.
If none of the selection categories match, Angular uses `other` to match the standard fallback for a missing category.

<!--todo: replace with docs-code -->

<docs-code language="html">

other { default_value }

</docs-code>

#### `gender` example

If you want to display the following phrase in English.

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

The author is other

</docs-code>

And you also want to display the following phrases based on the `gender` property of the component.

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

The author is female

</docs-code>

<!--todo: replace output docs-code with screen capture image --->

<docs-code language="html">

The author is male

</docs-code>

The following code example shows how to bind the `gender` property of the component and use the `select` clause to express the previous three situations in a `<span>` element.

The `gender` property binds the outputs to each of following string values.

| Value  | English value |
| :----- | :------------ |
| female | `female`      |
| male   | `male`        |
| other  | `other`       |

The `select` clause maps the values to the appropriate translations.
The following code example shows `gender` property used with the select clause.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-select"/>

#### `gender` and `minutes` example

Combine different clauses together, such as the `plural` and `select` clauses.
The following code example shows nested clauses based on the `gender` and `minutes` examples.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-nested"/>

# Work with translation files

After you prepare a component for translation, use the [`extract-i18n`][CliExtractI18n] [Angular CLI][CliMain] command to extract the marked text in the component into a *source language* file.

The marked text includes text marked with `i18n`, attributes marked with `i18n-`*attribute*, and text tagged with `$localize` as described in [Prepare component for translation][GuideI18nCommonPrepare].

Complete the following steps to create and update translation files for your project.

1. [Extract the source language file][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesExtractTheSourceLanguageFile].
    1. Optionally, change the location, format, and name.
1. Copy the source language file to [create a translation file for each language][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesCreateATranslationFileForEachLanguage].
1. [Translate each translation file][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesTranslateEachTranslationFile].
1. Translate plurals and alternate expressions separately.
    1. [Translate plurals][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesTranslatePlurals].
    1. [Translate alternate expressions][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesTranslateAlternateExpressions].
    1. [Translate nested expressions][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesTranslateNestedExpressions].

## Extract the source language file

To extract the source language file, complete the following actions.

1. Open a terminal window.
1. Change to the root directory of your project.
1. Run the following CLI command.

    <docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="extract-i18n-default"/>

The `extract-i18n` command creates a source language file named `messages.xlf` in the root directory of your project.
For more information about the XML Localization Interchange File Format \(XLIFF, version 1.2\), see [XLIFF][WikipediaWikiXliff].

Use the following [`extract-i18n`][CliExtractI18n] command options to change the source language file location, format, and file name.

| Command option  | Details |
|:---             |:---     |
| `--format`      | Set the format of the output file    |
| `--out-file`     | Set the name of the output file      |
| `--output-path` | Set the path of the output directory |

### Change the source language file location

To create a file in the `src/locale` directory, specify the output path as an option.

#### `extract-i18n --output-path` example

The following example specifies the output path as an option.

### Change the source language file format

The `extract-i18n` command creates files in the following translation formats.

| Translation format | Details                                                                                                          | File extension |
|:---                |:---                                                                                                              |:---            |
| ARB                | [Application Resource Bundle][GithubGoogleAppResourceBundleWikiApplicationresourcebundlespecification]           | `.arb`            |
| JSON               | [JavaScript Object Notation][JsonMain]                                                                           | `.json`           |
| XLIFF 1.2          | [XML Localization Interchange File Format, version 1.2][OasisOpenDocsXliffXliffCoreXliffCoreHtml]                | `.xlf`            |
| XLIFF 2            | [XML Localization Interchange File Format, version 2][OasisOpenDocsXliffXliffCoreV20Cos01XliffCoreV20Cose01Html] | `.xlf`            |
| XMB                | [XML Message Bundle][UnicodeCldrDevelopmentDevelopmentProcessDesignProposalsXmb]                                 | `.xmb` \(`.xtb`\) |

Specify the translation format explicitly with the `--format` command option.

HELPFUL: The XMB format generates `.xmb` source language files, but uses`.xtb` translation files.

#### `extract-i18n --format` example

The following example demonstrates several translation formats.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="extract-i18n-formats"/>

### Change the source language file name

To change the name of the source language file generated by the extraction tool, use the `--out-file` command option.

#### `extract-i18n --out-file` example

The following example demonstrates naming the output file.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/commands.sh" visibleRegion="extract-i18n-out-file"/>

## Create a translation file for each language

To create a translation file for a locale or language, complete the following actions.

1. [Extract the source language file][GuideI18nCommonTranslationFilesExtractTheSourceLanguageFile].
1. Make a copy of the source language file to create a *translation* file for each language.
1. Rename the *translation* file to add the locale.

    <docs-code language="file">

    messages.xlf --> messages.{locale}.xlf

    </docs-code>

1. Create a new directory at your project root named `locale`.

    <docs-code language="file">

    src/locale

    </docs-code>

1. Move the *translation* file to the new directory.
1. Send the *translation* file to your translator.
1. Repeat the above steps for each language you want to add to your application.

### `extract-i18n` example for French

For example, to create a French translation file, complete the following actions.

1. Run the `extract-i18n` command.
1. Make a copy of the `messages.xlf` source language file.
1. Rename the copy to `messages.fr.xlf` for the French language \(`fr`\) translation.
1. Move the `fr` translation file to the `src/locale` directory.
1. Send the `fr` translation file to the translator.

## Translate each translation file

Unless you are fluent in the language and have the time to edit translations, you will likely complete the following steps.

1. Send each translation file to a translator.
1. The translator uses an XLIFF file editor to complete the following actions.
    1. Create the translation.
    1. Edit the translation.

### Translation process example for French

To demonstrate the process, review the `messages.fr.xlf` file in the [Example Angular Internationalization application][GuideI18nExample].  The [Example Angular Internationalization application][GuideI18nExample] includes a French translation for you to edit without a special XLIFF editor or knowledge of French.

The following actions describe the translation process for French.

1. Open `messages.fr.xlf` and find the first `<trans-unit>` element.
    This is a *translation unit*, also known as a *text node*, that represents the translation of the `<h1>` greeting tag that was previously marked with the `i18n` attribute.

    <docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translated-hello-before"/>

    The `id="introductionHeader"` is a [custom ID][GuideI18nOptionalManageMarkedText], but without the `@@` prefix required in the source HTML.

1. Duplicate the `<source>... </source>` element in the text node, rename it to `target`, and then replace the content with the French text.

    <docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>, after translation)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translated-hello"/>

    In a more complex translation, the information and context in the [description and meaning elements][GuideI18nCommonPrepareAddHelpfulDescriptionsAndMeanings] help you choose the right words for translation.

1. Translate the other text nodes.
    The following example displays the way to translate.

    <docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translated-other-nodes"/>

IMPORTANT: Don't change the IDs for translation units.
Each `id` attribute is generated by Angular and depends on the content of the component text and the assigned meaning.

If you change either the text or the meaning, then the `id` attribute changes.
For more about managing text updates and IDs, see [custom IDs][GuideI18nOptionalManageMarkedText].

## Translate plurals

Add or remove plural cases as needed for each language.

HELPFUL: For language plural rules, see [CLDR plural rules][GithubUnicodeOrgCldrStagingChartsLatestSupplementalLanguagePluralRulesHtml].

### `minute` `plural` example

To translate a `plural`, translate the ICU format match values.

* `just now`
* `one minute ago`
* `<x id="INTERPOLATION" equiv-text="{{minutes}}"/> minutes ago`

The following example displays the way to translate.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translated-plural"/>

## Translate alternate expressions

Angular also extracts alternate `select` ICU expressions as separate translation units.

### `gender` `select` example

The following example displays a `select` ICU expression in the component template.

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="i18n-select"/>

In this example, Angular extracts the expression into two translation units.
The first contains the text outside of the `select` clause, and uses a placeholder for `select` \(`<x id="ICU">`\):

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translate-select-1"/>

IMPORTANT: When you translate the text, move the placeholder if necessary, but don't remove it.
If you remove the placeholder, the ICU expression is removed from your translated application.

The following example displays the second translation unit that contains the `select` clause.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translate-select-2"/>

The following example displays both translation units after translation is complete.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translated-select"/>

## Translate nested expressions

Angular treats a nested expression in the same manner as an alternate expression.
Angular extracts the expression into two translation units.

### Nested `plural` example

The following example displays the first translation unit that contains the text outside of the nested expression.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translate-nested-1"/>

The following example displays the second translation unit that contains the complete nested expression.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translate-nested-2"/>

The following example displays both translation units after translating.

<docs-code header="src/locale/messages.fr.xlf (<trans-unit>)" path="adev/src/content/examples/i18n/doc-files/messages.fr.xlf.html" visibleRegion="translate-nested"/>

# NgModules

IMPORTANT: The Angular team recommends using [standalone components](guide/components/anatomy-of-components#-imports-in-the-component-decorator) instead of `NgModule` for all new code. Use this guide to understand existing code built with `@NgModule`.

An NgModule is a class marked by the `@NgModule` decorator. This decorator accepts *metadata* that tells Angular how to compile component templates and configure dependency injection.

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  // Metadata goes here
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

An NgModule has two main responsibilities:
* Declaring components, directives, and pipes that belong to the NgModule
* Add providers to the injector for components, directives, and pipes that import the NgModule

## Declarations

The `declarations` property of the `@NgModule` metadata declares the components, directives, and pipes that belong to the NgModule.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  /* ... */
  // CustomMenu and CustomMenuItem are components.
  declarations: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

In the example above, the components `CustomMenu` and `CustomMenuItem` belong to `CustomMenuModule`.

The `declarations` property additionally accepts _arrays_ of components, directives, and pipes. These arrays, in turn, may also contain other arrays.

```typescript
const MENU_COMPONENTS = [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem];
const WIDGETS = [MENU_COMPONENTS, CustomSlider];

@NgModule({
  /* ... */
  // This NgModule declares all of CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem,
  // CustomSlider, and CustomCheckbox.
  declarations: [WIDGETS, CustomCheckbox],
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

If Angular discovers any components, directives, or pipes declared in more than one NgModule, it reports an error.

Any components, directives, or pipes must be explicitly marked as `standalone: false` in order to be declared in an NgModule.

```typescript
@Component({
  // Mark this component as `standalone: false` so that it can be declared in an NgModule.
  standalone: false,
  /* ... */
})
export class CustomMenu { /* ... */ }
```

### imports

Components declared in an NgModule may depend on other components, directives, and pipes. Add these dependencies to the `imports` property of the `@NgModule` metadata.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  /* ... */
  // CustomMenu and CustomMenuItem depend on the PopupTrigger and SelectorIndicator components.
  imports: [PopupTrigger, SelectionIndicator],
  declarations: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

The `imports` array accepts other NgModules, as well as standalone components, directives, and pipes.

### exports

An NgModule can _export_ its declared components, directives, and pipes such that they're available to other components and NgModules.

 ```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [PopupTrigger, SelectionIndicator],
  declarations: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],

  // Make CustomMenu and CustomMenuItem available to
  // components and NgModules that import CustomMenuModule.
  exports: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

The `exports` property is not limited to declarations, however. An NgModule can also export any other components, directives, pipes, and NgModules that it imports.

 ```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [PopupTrigger, SelectionIndicator],
  declarations: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],

  // Also make PopupTrigger available to any component or NgModule that imports CustomMenuModule.
  exports: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem, PopupTrigger],
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }
```

## `NgModule` providers

TIP: See the [Dependency Injection guide](guide/di) for information on dependency injection and providers.

An `NgModule` can specify `providers` for injected dependencies. These providers are available to:
* Any standalone component, directive, or pipe that imports the NgModule, and
* The `declarations` and `providers` of any _other_ NgModule that imports the NgModule.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [PopupTrigger, SelectionIndicator],
  declarations: [CustomMenu, CustomMenuItem],

  // Provide the OverlayManager service
  providers: [OverlayManager],
  /* ... */
})
export class CustomMenuModule { }

@NgModule({
  imports: [CustomMenuModule],
  declarations: [UserProfile],
  providers: [UserDataClient],
})
export class UserProfileModule { }
```

In the example above:
* The `CustomMenuModule` provides `OverlayManager`.
* The `CustomMenu` and `CustomMenuItem` components can inject `OverlayManager` because they're declared in `CustomMenuModule`.
* `UserProfile` can inject `OverlayManager` because its NgModule imports `CustomMenuModule`.
* `UserDataClient` can inject `OverlayManager` because its NgModule imports `CustomMenuModule`.

### The `forRoot` and `forChild` pattern

Some NgModules define a static `forRoot` method that accepts some configuration and returns an array of providers. The name "`forRoot`" is a convention that indicates that these providers are intended to be added exclusively to the _root_ of your application during bootstrap.

Any providers included in this way are eagerly loaded, increasing the JavaScript bundle size of your initial page load.

```typescript
boorstrapApplication(MyApplicationRoot, {
  providers: [
    CustomMenuModule.forRoot(/* some config */),
  ],
});
```

Similarly, some NgModules may define a static `forChild` that indicates the providers are intended to be added to components within your application hierarchy.

```typescript
@Component({
  /* ... */
  providers: [
    CustomMenuModule.forChild(/* some config */),
  ],
})
export class UserProfile { /* ... */ }
```

## Bootstrapping an application

IMPORTANT: The Angular team recommends using [bootstrapApplication](api/platform-browser/bootstrapApplication) instead of `bootstrapModule` for all new code. Use this guide to understand existing applications bootstrapped with `@NgModule`.

The `@NgModule` decorator accepts an optional `bootstrap` array that may contain one or more components.

You can use the [`bootstrapModule`](https://angular.dev/api/core/PlatformRef#bootstrapModule) method from either [`platformBrowser`](api/platform-browser/platformBrowser) or [`platformServer`](api/platform-server/platformServer) to start an Angular application. When run, this function locates any elements on the page with a CSS selector that matches the listed componet(s) and renders those components on the page.

```typescript
import {platformBrowser} from '@angular/platform-browser';

@NgModule({
  bootstrap: [MyApplication],
})
export class MyApplicationModule { }

platformBrowser().bootstrapModule(MyApplicationModule);
```

Components listed in `bootstrap` are automatically included in the NgModule's declarations.

When you bootstrap an application from an NgModule, the collected `providers` of this module and all of the `providers` of its `imports` are eagerly loaded and available to inject for the entire application.

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/pipes/change-detection.md
================================================
# Change detection with pipes

Pipes are often used with data-bound values that might change based on user actions.
If the data is a primitive input value, such as `String` or `Number`, or an object reference as input, such as `Date` or `Array`, Angular executes the pipe whenever it detects a change for the value.

<docs-code-multifile path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/power-booster.component.ts">
  <docs-code header="src/app/exponential-strength.pipe.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/exponential-strength.pipe.ts"
             highlight="[16]" visibleRegion="pipe-class" />
  <docs-code header="src/app/power-booster.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/power-booster.component.ts"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

The `exponentialStrength` pipe executes every time the user changes the value or the exponent. See the highlighted line above.

Angular detects each change and immediately runs the pipe.
This is fine for primitive input values.
However, if you change something *inside* a composite object (such as the month of a date, an element of an array, or an object property), you need to understand how change detection works, and how to use an `impure` pipe.

## How change detection works

Angular looks for changes to data-bound values in a change detection process that runs after every DOM event: every keystroke, mouse move, timer tick, and server response.
The following example, which doesn't use a pipe, demonstrates how Angular uses its default change detection strategy to monitor and update its display of every hero in the `heroes` array.
The example tabs show the following:

| Files                               | Details |
|:---                                 |:---     |
| `flying-heroes.component.html (v1)` | The `*ngFor` repeater displays the hero names.                     |
| `flying-heroes.component.ts (v1)`   | Provides heroes, adds heroes into the array, and resets the array. |

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.component.html (v1)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.component.html" visibleRegion="template-1"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.component.ts (v1)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.component.ts" visibleRegion="v1"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

Angular updates the display every time the user adds a hero.
If the user clicks the **Reset** button, Angular replaces `heroes` with a new array of the original heroes and updates the display.
If you add the ability to remove or change a hero, Angular would detect those changes and update the display as well.

However, executing a pipe to update the display with every change would slow down your application's performance.
So Angular uses a faster change-detection algorithm for executing a pipe, as described in the next section.

## Detecting pure changes to primitives and object references

By default, pipes are defined as *pure* so that Angular executes the pipe only when it detects a *pure change* to the input value or parameters.
A pure change is either a change to a primitive input value \(such as `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, or `Symbol`\), or a changed object reference \(such as `Date`, `Array`, `Function`, or `Object`\).

A pure pipe must use a pure function, which is one that processes inputs and returns values without side effects.
In other words, given the same input, a pure function should always return the same output.

With a pure pipe, Angular ignores changes within objects and arrays because checking a primitive value or object reference is much faster than performing a deep check for differences within objects.
Angular can quickly determine if it can skip executing the pipe and updating the view.

However, a pure pipe with an array as input might not work the way you want.
To demonstrate this issue, change the previous example to filter the list of heroes to just those heroes who can fly.

For this, consider we use the `FlyingHeroesPipe` in the `*ngFor` repeater as shown in the following code.
The tabs for the example show the following:

| Files                          | Details |
|:---                            |:---     |
| flying-heroes.component.html   | Template with the new pipe used. |
| flying-heroes.pipe.ts          | File with custom pipe that filters flying heroes. |

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.component.html" visibleRegion="template-flying-heroes"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" visibleRegion="pure"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

The application now shows unexpected behavior: When the user adds flying heroes, none of them appear under "Heroes who fly."
This happens because the code that adds a hero does so by pushing it onto the `heroes` array that is used as input for the `flyingHeroes` pipe.

<docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.component.ts" visibleRegion="push"/>

The change detector ignores changes within elements of an array, so the pipe doesn't run.
The reason Angular ignores the changed array element is that the *reference* to the array hasn't changed.
Because the array is the same, Angular does not update the display.

One way to get the behavior you want is to change the object reference itself.
Replace the array with a new array containing the newly changed elements, and then input the new array to the pipe.
In the preceding example, create an array with the new hero appended, and assign that to `heroes`.
Angular detects the change in the array reference and executes the pipe.

To summarize, if you mutate the input array, the pure pipe doesn't execute.
If you *replace* the input array, the pipe executes and the display is updated.
As an alternative, use an *impure* pipe to detect changes within composite objects such as arrays, as described in the next section.

## Detecting impure changes within composite objects

To execute a custom pipe after a change *within* a composite object, such as a change to an element of an array, you need to define your pipe as `impure` to detect impure changes.
Angular executes an impure pipe every time it detects a change (e.g. every keystroke or mouse event).

IMPORTANT: While an impure pipe can be useful, be careful using one.
A long-running impure pipe could dramatically slow down your application.

Make a pipe impure by setting its `pure` flag to `false`:

<docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts"
           visibleRegion="pipe-decorator" highlight="[19]"/>

The following code shows the complete implementation of `FlyingHeroesImpurePipe`, which extends `FlyingHeroesPipe` to inherit its characteristics.
The example shows that you don't have to change anything else—the only difference is setting the `pure` flag as `false` in the pipe metadata.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts (FlyingHeroesImpurePipe)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" visibleRegion="impure"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts (FlyingHeroesPipe)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" visibleRegion="pure"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

`FlyingHeroesImpurePipe` is a reasonable candidate for an impure pipe because the `transform` function is trivial and fast:

<docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts (filter)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes.pipe.ts" visibleRegion="filter"/>

You can derive a `FlyingHeroesImpureComponent` from `FlyingHeroesComponent`.
As shown in the following code, only the pipe in the template changes.

<docs-code header="src/app/flying-heroes-impure.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/pipes/src/app/flying-heroes-impure.component.html" visibleRegion="template-flying-heroes"/>

# Understanding Pipes

Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.

## What is a pipe

Pipes are simple functions to use in templates to accept an input value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each pipe once.
For example, you would use a pipe to show a date as **April 15, 1988** rather than the raw string format.

You can create your own custom pipes to expose reusable transformations in templates.

## Built-in pipes

Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization (i18n), which use locale information to format data.
The following are commonly used built-in pipes for data formatting:

- [`DatePipe`](api/common/DatePipe): Formats a date value according to locale rules.
- [`UpperCasePipe`](api/common/UpperCasePipe): Transforms text to all upper case.
- [`LowerCasePipe`](api/common/LowerCasePipe): Transforms text to all lower case.
- [`CurrencyPipe`](api/common/CurrencyPipe): Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
- [`DecimalPipe`](/api/common/DecimalPipe): Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.
- [`PercentPipe`](api/common/PercentPipe): Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.
- [`AsyncPipe`](api/common/AsyncPipe): Subscribe and unsubscribe to an asynchronous source such as an observable.
- [`JsonPipe`](api/common/JsonPipe): Display a component object property to the screen as JSON for debugging.

NOTE: For a complete list of built-in pipes, see the [pipes API documentation](/api?type=pipe "Pipes API reference summary").
To learn more about using pipes for internationalization (i18n) efforts, see [formatting data based on locale](guide/i18n/format-data-locale).



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/pipes/precedence.md
================================================
# Pipe precedence in template expressions

Sometimes you want to choose between two values, based on some condition, before passing the choice to the pipe.
You could use the JavaScript ternary operator (`?:`) in the template to make that choice.

Beware! The pipe operator has a higher precedence than the JavaScript ternary operator (`?:`).

If you simply write the expression as if it were evaluated left-to-right, you might be surprised by the result. For example,

```ts
condition ? a : b | pipe
```

is parsed as

```ts
condition ? a : (b | pipe)
```

The value of `b` passes through `pipe`; the value of `a` *will not*.

If you want the pipe to apply to the result of the ternary expression, wrap the entire expression in parentheses. For example,

```ts
(condition ? a : b) | pipe
```

In general, you should always use parentheses to be sure Angular evaluates the expression as you intend.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/pipes/template.md
================================================
# Using a pipe in a template

To apply a pipe, use the pipe operator (`|`) within a template expression as shown in the following code example.

<docs-code language="angular-html" header="app.component.html">
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>
</docs-code>

The component's `birthday` value flows through the pipe operator (`|`) to the [`DatePipe`](api/common/DatePipe) whose pipe name is `date`.
The pipe renders the date in the default format like **Apr 07, 2023**.

<docs-code header="app.component.ts" preview>
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DatePipe } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  imports: [DatePipe],
})
export class AppComponent {
  birthday = new Date();
}
</docs-code>

## Additional parameters for pipes

Pipes can take additional parameters that configure the transformation. Parameters can be optional or required.

For example, the `date` pipe takes optional parameters that control the date's display format.
To specify the parameter, follow the pipe name with a colon (`:`) and the parameter value (the format).

<docs-code language="angular-html" header="app.component.html">
<p>The hero's birthday is in {{ birthday | date:'yyyy' }}</p>
</docs-code>

Pipes can also take multiple parameters. You can pass multiple parameters by separating these via colons (`:`).
For example, the `date` pipe accepts a second optional parameter for controlling the timezone.

<docs-code header="app.component.html">
<p>The current time is: {{ currentTime | date:'hh:mm':'UTC' }}</p>
</docs-code>

This will display the current time (like `10:53`) in the `UTC` timezone.

## Chaining pipes

You can connect multiple pipes so that the output of one pipe becomes the input to the next.

The following example passes a date to the `DatePipe` and then forwards the result to the [`UpperCasePipe`](api/common/UpperCasePipe 'API reference') pipe.

<docs-code language="angular-html" header="app.component.html">
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>
<p>The hero's birthday is in {{ birthday | date:'yyyy' | uppercase }}</p>
</docs-code>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/pipes/transform-data.md
================================================
# Custom pipes for new transforms

Create custom pipes to encapsulate transformations that are not provided with the built-in pipes.
Then, use your custom pipe in template expressions, the same way you use built-in pipes—to transform input values to output values for display.

## Marking a class as a pipe

To mark a class as a pipe and supply configuration metadata, apply the `@Pipe` to the class.

Use UpperCamelCase (the general convention for class names) for the pipe class name, and camelCase for the corresponding `name` string.
Do not use hyphens in the `name`.

For details and more examples, see [Pipe names](/style-guide#pipe-names "Pipe names in the Angular coding style guide").

Use `name` in template expressions as you would for a built-in pipe.

```ts
import { Pipe } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'greet',
})
export class GreetPipe {}
```

## Using the PipeTransform interface

Implement the [`PipeTransform`](/api/core/PipeTransform "API reference for PipeTransform") interface in your custom pipe class to perform the transformation.

Angular invokes the `transform` method with the value of a binding as the first argument, and any parameters as the second argument in list form, and returns the transformed value.

```ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'greet',
})
export class GreetPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string, param1: boolean, param2: boolean): string {
    return `Hello ${value}`;
  }
}
```

## Example: Transforming a value exponentially

In a game, you might want to implement a transformation that raises a value exponentially to increase a hero's power.
For example, if the hero's score is 2, boosting the hero's power exponentially by 10 produces a score of 1024 (`2**10`).
Use a custom pipe for this transformation.

The following code example shows two component definitions:

| Files                          | Details |
|:---                            |:---     |
| `exponential-strength.pipe.ts` | Defines a custom pipe named `exponentialStrength` with the `transform` method that performs the transformation. It defines an argument to the `transform` method \(`exponent`\) for a parameter passed to the pipe. |
| `power-booster.component.ts`   | Demonstrates how to use the pipe, specifying a value \(`2`\) and the exponent parameter \(`10`\).                                                                                                                   |

================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/pipes/unwrapping-data-observables.md
================================================
# Unwrapping data from an observable

Observables let you pass messages between parts of your application.
You can use observables for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values.
Observables can deliver single or multiple values of any type, either synchronously (as a function delivers a value to its caller) or asynchronously on a schedule.

Use the built-in [`AsyncPipe`](api/common/AsyncPipe "API description of AsyncPipe") to accept an observable as input and subscribe to the input automatically.
Without this pipe, your component code would have to subscribe to the observable to consume its values, extract the resolved values, expose them for binding, and unsubscribe when the observable is destroyed in order to prevent memory leaks.
`AsyncPipe` is a pipe that saves boilerplate code in your component to maintain the subscription and keep delivering values from that observable as they arrive.

The following code example binds an observable of message strings (`message$`) to a view with the `async` pipe.

# Common Routing Tasks

This topic describes how to implement many of the common tasks associated with adding the Angular router to your application.

## Generate an application with routing enabled

The following command uses the Angular CLI to generate a basic Angular application with application routes. The application name in the following example is `routing-app`.

```shell
ng new routing-app
```

### Adding components for routing

To use the Angular router, an application needs to have at least two components so that it can navigate from one to the other. To create a component using the CLI, enter the following at the command line where `first` is the name of your component:

```shell
ng generate component first
```

Repeat this step for a second component but give it a different name. Here, the new name is `second`.

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate component second

</docs-code>

The CLI automatically appends `Component`, so if you were to write `first-component`, your component would be `FirstComponentComponent`.

<docs-callout title="`base href`">

This guide works with a CLI-generated Angular application. If you are working manually, make sure that you have `<base href="/">` in the `<head>` of your index.html file.
This assumes that the `app` folder is the application root, and uses `"/"`.

</docs-callout>

### Importing your new components

To use your new components, import them into `app.routes.ts` at the top of the file, as follows:

<docs-code language="ts">

import {FirstComponent} from './first/first.component';
import {SecondComponent} from './second/second.component';

</docs-code>

## Defining a basic route

There are three fundamental building blocks to creating a route.

Import the routes into `app.config.ts` and add it to the `provideRouter` function. The following is the default `ApplicationConfig` using the CLI.

<docs-code language="ts">

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)]
};

</docs-code>

The Angular CLI performs this step for you. However, if you are creating an application manually or working with an existing, non-CLI application, verify that the imports and configuration are correct.

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Set up a `Routes` array for your routes">

The Angular CLI performs this step automatically.

```ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';

export const routes: Routes = [];
```

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Define your routes in your `Routes` array">

Each route in this array is a JavaScript object that contains two properties. The first property, `path`, defines the URL path for the route. The second property, `component`, defines the component Angular should use for the corresponding path.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'first-component', component: FirstComponent },
  { path: 'second-component', component: SecondComponent },
];
```

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Add your routes to your application">

Now that you have defined your routes, add them to your application. First, add links to the two components. Assign the anchor tag that you want to add the route to the `routerLink` attribute. Set the value of the attribute to the component to show when a user clicks on each link. Next, update your component template to include `<router-outlet>`. This element informs Angular to update the application view with the component for the selected route.

```angular-html
<h1>Angular Router App</h1>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="/first-component" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">First Component</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="/second-component" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page">Second Component</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<!-- The routed views render in the <router-outlet>-->
<router-outlet />
```

You also need to add the `RouterLink`, `RouterLinkActive`, and `RouterOutlet` to the `imports` array of `AppComponent`.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink, RouterLinkActive],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'routing-app';
}
```

</docs-step>

</docs-workflow>

### Route order

The order of routes is important because the `Router` uses a first-match wins strategy when matching routes, so more specific routes should be placed above less specific routes.
List routes with a static path first, followed by an empty path route, which matches the default route.
The [wildcard route](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#setting-up-wildcard-routes) comes last because it matches every URL and the `Router` selects it only if no other routes match first.

## Getting route information

Often, as a user navigates your application, you want to pass information from one component to another.
For example, consider an application that displays a shopping list of grocery items.
Each item in the list has a unique `id`.
To edit an item, users click an Edit button, which opens an `EditGroceryItem` component.
You want that component to retrieve the `id` for the grocery item so it can display the right information to the user.

Use a route to pass this type of information to your application components.
To do so, you use the [withComponentInputBinding](api/router/withComponentInputBinding) feature with `provideRouter` or the `bindToComponentInputs` option of `RouterModule.forRoot`.

To get information from a route:

<docs-workflow>

<docs-step title="Add `withComponentInputBinding`">

Add the `withComponentInputBinding` feature to the `provideRouter` method.

```ts
providers: [
  provideRouter(appRoutes, withComponentInputBinding()),
]
```

</docs-step>

<docs-step title="Add an `Input` to the component">

Update the component to have an `Input` matching the name of the parameter.

```ts
@Input()
set id(heroId: string) {
  this.hero$ = this.service.getHero(heroId);
}
```

NOTE: You can bind all route data with key, value pairs to component inputs: static or resolved route data, path parameters, matrix parameters, and query parameters.
If you want to use the parent components route info you will need to set the router `paramsInheritanceStrategy` option:
`withRouterConfig({paramsInheritanceStrategy: 'always'})`

</docs-step>

</docs-workflow>

## Setting up wildcard routes

A well-functioning application should gracefully handle when users attempt to navigate to a part of your application that does not exist.
To add this functionality to your application, you set up a wildcard route.
The Angular router selects this route any time the requested URL doesn't match any router paths.

To set up a wildcard route, add the following code to your `routes` definition.

<docs-code>

{ path: '**', component: <component-name> }

</docs-code>

The two asterisks, `**`, indicate to Angular that this `routes` definition is a wildcard route.
For the component property, you can define any component in your application.
Common choices include an application-specific `PageNotFoundComponent`, which you can define to [display a 404 page](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#displaying-a-404-page) to your users; or a redirect to your application's main component.
A wildcard route is the last route because it matches any URL.
For more detail on why order matters for routes, see [Route order](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#route-order).

## Displaying a 404 page

To display a 404 page, set up a [wildcard route](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#setting-up-wildcard-routes) with the `component` property set to the component you'd like to use for your 404 page as follows:

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'first-component', component: FirstComponent },
  { path: 'second-component', component: SecondComponent },
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent },  // Wildcard route for a 404 page
];
```

The last route with the `path` of `**` is a wildcard route.
The router selects this route if the requested URL doesn't match any of the paths earlier in the list and sends the user to the `PageNotFoundComponent`.

## Setting up redirects

To set up a redirect, configure a route with the `path` you want to redirect from, the `component` you want to redirect to, and a `pathMatch` value that tells the router how to match the URL.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'first-component', component: FirstComponent },
  { path: 'second-component', component: SecondComponent },
  { path: '',   redirectTo: '/first-component', pathMatch: 'full' }, // redirect to `first-component`
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent },  // Wildcard route for a 404 page
];
```

In this example, the third route is a redirect so that the router defaults to the `first-component` route.
Notice that this redirect precedes the wildcard route.
Here, `path: ''` means to use the initial relative URL \(`''`\).

Sometimes a redirect is not a simple, static redirect. The `redirectTo` property can also be a function
with more complex logic that returns a string or `UrlTree`.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "first-component", component: FirstComponent },
  {
    path: "old-user-page",
    redirectTo: ({ queryParams }) => {
      const errorHandler = inject(ErrorHandler);
      const userIdParam = queryParams['userId'];
      if (userIdParam !== undefined) {
        return `/user/${userIdParam}`;
      } else {
        errorHandler.handleError(new Error('Attempted navigation to user page without user ID.'));
        return `/not-found`;
      }
    },
  },
  { path: "user/:userId", component: OtherComponent },
];
```

## Nesting routes

As your application grows more complex, you might want to create routes that are relative to a component other than your root component.
These types of nested routes are called child routes.
This means you're adding a second `<router-outlet>` to your app, because it is in addition to the `<router-outlet>` in `AppComponent`.

In this example, there are two additional child components, `child-a`, and `child-b`.
Here, `FirstComponent` has its own `<nav>` and a second `<router-outlet>` in addition to the one in `AppComponent`.

```angular-html
<h2>First Component</h2>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="child-a">Child A</a></li>
    <li><a routerLink="child-b">Child B</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<router-outlet />
```

A child route is like any other route, in that it needs both a `path` and a `component`.
The one difference is that you place child routes in a `children` array within the parent route.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'first-component',
    component: FirstComponent, // this is the component with the <router-outlet> in the template
    children: [
      {
        path: 'child-a', // child route path
        component: ChildAComponent, // child route component that the router renders
      },
      {
        path: 'child-b',
        component: ChildBComponent, // another child route component that the router renders
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

## Setting the page title

Each page in your application should have a unique title so that they can be identified in the browser history.
The `Router` sets the document's title using the `title` property from the `Route` config.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'first-component',
    title: 'First component',
    component: FirstComponent,  // this is the component with the <router-outlet> in the template
    children: [
      {
        path: 'child-a',  // child route path
        title: resolvedChildATitle,
        component: ChildAComponent,  // child route component that the router renders
      },
      {
        path: 'child-b',
        title: 'child b',
        component: ChildBComponent,  // another child route component that the router renders
      },
    ],
  },
];

const resolvedChildATitle: ResolveFn<string> = () => Promise.resolve('child a');
```

HELPFUL: The `title` property follows the same rules as static route `data` and dynamic values that implement `ResolveFn`.

You can also provide a custom title strategy by extending the `TitleStrategy`.

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class TemplatePageTitleStrategy extends TitleStrategy {
  private readonly title = inject(Title);

  override updateTitle(routerState: RouterStateSnapshot) {
    const title = this.buildTitle(routerState);
    if (title !== undefined) {
      this.title.setTitle(`My Application | ${title}`);
    }
  }
}

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes),
    { provide: TitleStrategy, useClass: TemplatePageTitleStrategy },
  ]
};
```

## Using relative paths

Relative paths let you define paths that are relative to the current URL segment.
The following example shows a relative route to another component, `second-component`.
`FirstComponent` and `SecondComponent` are at the same level in the tree, however, the link to `SecondComponent` is situated within the `FirstComponent`, meaning that the router has to go up a level and then into the second directory to find the `SecondComponent`.
Rather than writing out the whole path to get to `SecondComponent`, use the `../` notation to go up a level.

```angular-html
<h2>First Component</h2>

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a routerLink="../second-component">Relative Route to second component</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<router-outlet />
```

In addition to `../`, use `./` or no leading slash to specify the current level.

### Specifying a relative route

To specify a relative route, use the `NavigationExtras` `relativeTo` property.
In the component class, import `NavigationExtras` from the `@angular/router`.

Then use `relativeTo` in your navigation method.
After the link parameters array, which here contains `items`, add an object with the `relativeTo` property set to the `ActivatedRoute`, which is `this.route`.

```ts
goToItems() {
  this.router.navigate(['items'], { relativeTo: this.route });
}
```

The `navigate()` arguments configure the router to use the current route as a basis upon which to append `items`.

The `goToItems()` method interprets the destination URI as relative to the activated route and navigates to the `items` route.

## Accessing query parameters and fragments

Sometimes, a feature of your application requires accessing a part of a route, such as a query parameter or a fragment.
In this example, the route contains an `id` parameter we can use to target a specific hero page.

```ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from "@angular/core";
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HeroListComponent } from './hero-list.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'hero/:id', component: HeroDetailComponent }
];

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)],
};
```

First, import the following members in the component you want to navigate from.

```ts
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable, switchMap } from 'rxjs';
```

Next inject the activated route service:

```ts
private readonly route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
```

Configure the class so that you have an observable, `heroes$`, a `selectedId` to hold the `id` number of the hero, and the heroes in the `ngOnInit()`, add the following code to get the `id` of the selected hero.
This code snippet assumes that you have a heroes list, a hero service, a function to get your heroes, and the HTML to render your list and details, just as in the Tour of Heroes example.

```ts
heroes$: Observable<Hero[]>;
selectedId: number;
heroes = HEROES;

ngOnInit() {
  this.heroes$ = this.route.paramMap.pipe(
    switchMap(params => {
      this.selectedId = Number(params.get('id'));
      return this.service.getHeroes();
    })
  );
}
```

Next, in the component that you want to navigate to, import the following members.

```ts
import { Router, ActivatedRoute, ParamMap } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
```

Inject `ActivatedRoute` and `Router` in the constructor of the component class so they are available to this component:

```ts
private readonly route = inject(ActivatedRoute);
private readonly router = inject(Router);

hero$: Observable<Hero>;

ngOnInit() {
  const heroId = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
  this.hero$ = this.service.getHero(heroId);
}

gotoItems(hero: Hero) {
  const heroId = hero ? hero.id : null;
  // Pass along the hero id if available
  // so that the HeroList component can select that item.
  this.router.navigate(['/heroes', { id: heroId }]);
}
```

## Lazy loading

You can configure your routes to lazy load modules, which means that Angular only loads modules as needed, rather than loading all modules when the application launches.
Additionally, preload parts of your application in the background to improve the user experience.

Any route can lazily load its routed, standalone component by using `loadComponent:`

<docs-code header="Lazy loading a standalone component" language="typescript">

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'lazy',
    loadComponent: () => import('./lazy.component').then(c => c.LazyComponent)
  }
];
</docs-code>
This works as long as the loaded component is standalone.

## Preventing unauthorized access

Use route guards to prevent users from navigating to parts of an application without authorization.
The following route guards are available in Angular:

<docs-pill-row>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/CanActivateFn" title="`canActivate`"/>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/CanActivateChildFn" title="`canActivateChild`"/>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/CanDeactivateFn" title="`canDeactivate`"/>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/CanMatchFn" title="`canMatch`"/>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/ResolveFn" title="`resolve`"/>
  <docs-pill href="api/router/CanLoadFn" title="`canLoad`"/>
</docs-pill-row>

To use route guards, consider using [component-less routes](api/router/Route#componentless-routes) as this facilitates guarding child routes.

Create a file for your guard:

```bash
ng generate guard your-guard
```

In your guard file, add the guard functions you want to use.
The following example uses `canActivateFn` to guard the route.

```ts
export const yourGuardFunction: CanActivateFn = (
  next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
  state: RouterStateSnapshot
) => {
  // your  logic goes here
}
```

In your routing module, use the appropriate property in your `routes` configuration.
Here, `canActivate` tells the router to mediate navigation to this particular route.

```ts
{
  path: '/your-path',
  component: YourComponent,
  canActivate: [yourGuardFunction],
}
```

## Link parameters array

A link parameters array holds the following ingredients for router navigation:

- The path of the route to the destination component
- Required and optional route parameters that go into the route URL

Bind the `RouterLink` directive to such an array like this:

```angular-html
<a [routerLink]="['/heroes']">Heroes</a>
```

The following is a two-element array when specifying a route parameter:

```angular-html
<a [routerLink]="['/hero', hero.id]">
  <span class="badge">{{ hero.id }}</span>{{ hero.name }}
</a>
```

Provide optional route parameters in an object, as in `{ foo: 'foo' }`:

```angular-html
<a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center', { foo: 'foo' }]">Crisis Center</a>
```

These three examples cover the needs of an application with one level of routing.
However, with a child router, such as in the crisis center, you create new link array possibilities.

The following minimal `RouterLink` example builds upon a specified default child route for the crisis center.

```angular-html
<a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center']">Crisis Center</a>
```

Review the following:

- The first item in the array identifies the parent route \(`/crisis-center`\)
- There are no parameters for this parent route
- There is no default for the child route so you need to pick one
- You're navigating to the `CrisisListComponent`, whose route path is `/`, but you don't need to explicitly add the slash

Consider the following router link that navigates from the root of the application down to the Dragon Crisis:

```angular-html
<a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center', 1]">Dragon Crisis</a>
```

- The first item in the array identifies the parent route \(`/crisis-center`\)
- There are no parameters for this parent route
- The second item identifies the child route details about a particular crisis \(`/:id`\)
- The details child route requires an `id` route parameter
- You added the `id` of the Dragon Crisis as the second item in the array \(`1`\)
- The resulting path is `/crisis-center/1`

You could also redefine the `AppComponent` template with Crisis Center routes exclusively:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <h1 class="title">Angular Router</h1>
    <nav>
      <a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center']">Crisis Center</a>
      <a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center/1', { foo: 'foo' }]">Dragon Crisis</a>
      <a [routerLink]="['/crisis-center/2']">Shark Crisis</a>
    </nav>
    <router-outlet />
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

In summary, you can write applications with one, two or more levels of routing.
The link parameters array affords the flexibility to represent any routing depth and any legal sequence of route paths, \(required\) router parameters, and \(optional\) route parameter objects.

## `LocationStrategy` and browser URL styles

When the router navigates to a new component view, it updates the browser's location and history with a URL for that view.

Modern HTML5 browsers support [history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#adding_and_modifying_history_entries 'HTML5 browser history push-state'), a technique that changes a browser's location and history without triggering a server page request.
The router can compose a "natural" URL that is indistinguishable from one that would otherwise require a page load.

Here's the Crisis Center URL in this "HTML5 pushState" style:

```text
localhost:3002/crisis-center
```

Older browsers send page requests to the server when the location URL changes unless the change occurs after a "#" \(called the "hash"\).
Routers can take advantage of this exception by composing in-application route URLs with hashes.
Here's a "hash URL" that routes to the Crisis Center.

```text
localhost:3002/src/#/crisis-center
```

The router supports both styles with two `LocationStrategy` providers:

| Providers              | Details                              |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `PathLocationStrategy` | The default "HTML5 pushState" style. |
| `HashLocationStrategy` | The "hash URL" style.                |

The `RouterModule.forRoot()` function sets the `LocationStrategy` to the `PathLocationStrategy`, which makes it the default strategy.
You also have the option of switching to the `HashLocationStrategy` with an override during the bootstrapping process.

HELPFUL: For more information on providers and the bootstrap process, see [Dependency Injection](guide/di/dependency-injection-providers).

## Choosing a routing strategy

You must choose a routing strategy early in the development of your project because once the application is in production, visitors to your site use and depend on application URL references.

Almost all Angular projects should use the default HTML5 style.
It produces URLs that are easier for users to understand and it preserves the option to do server-side rendering.

Rendering critical pages on the server is a technique that can greatly improve perceived responsiveness when the application first loads.
An application that would otherwise take ten or more seconds to start could be rendered on the server and delivered to the user's device in less than a second.

This option is only available if application URLs look like normal web URLs without hash \(`#`\) characters in the middle.

## `<base href>`

The router uses the browser's [history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#adding_and_modifying_history_entries 'HTML5 browser history push-state') for navigation.
`pushState` lets you customize in-application URL paths; for example, `localhost:4200/crisis-center`.
The in-application URLs can be indistinguishable from server URLs.

Modern HTML5 browsers were the first to support `pushState` which is why many people refer to these URLs as "HTML5 style" URLs.

HELPFUL: HTML5 style navigation is the router default.
In the [LocationStrategy and browser URL styles](#locationstrategy-and-browser-url-styles) section, learn why HTML5 style is preferable, how to adjust its behavior, and how to switch to the older hash \(`#`\) style, if necessary.

You must add a [`<base href>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base 'base href') to the application's `index.html` for `pushState` routing to work.
The browser uses the `<base href>` value to prefix relative URLs when referencing CSS files, scripts, and images.

Add the `<base>` element just after the `<head>` tag.
If the `app` folder is the application root, as it is for this application, set the `href` value in `index.html` as shown here.

<docs-code header="src/index.html (base-href)" path="adev/src/content/examples/router/src/index.html" visibleRegion="base-href"/>

### HTML5 URLs and the `<base href>`

The guidelines that follow will refer to different parts of a URL.
This diagram outlines what those parts refer to:

<docs-code hideCopy language="text">
foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
\_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
 |           |            |            |        |
scheme    authority      path        query   fragment
</docs-code>

While the router uses the [HTML5 pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries 'Browser history push-state') style by default, you must configure that strategy with a `<base href>`.

The preferred way to configure the strategy is to add a [`<base href>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base 'base href') tag in the `<head>` of the `index.html`.

```angular-html
<base href="/">
```

Without that tag, the browser might not be able to load resources \(images, CSS, scripts\) when "deep linking" into the application.

Some developers might not be able to add the `<base>` element, perhaps because they don't have access to `<head>` or the `index.html`.

Those developers can still use HTML5 URLs by taking the following two steps:

1. Provide the router with an appropriate `APP_BASE_HREF` value.
1. Use root URLs \(URLs with an `authority`\) for all web resources: CSS, images, scripts, and template HTML files.

   - The `<base href>` `path` should end with a "/", as browsers ignore characters in the `path` that follow the right-most "`/`"
   - If the `<base href>` includes a `query` part, the `query` is only used if the `path` of a link in the page is empty and has no `query`.
     This means that a `query` in the `<base href>` is only included when using `HashLocationStrategy`.

   - If a link in the page is a root URL \(has an `authority`\), the `<base href>` is not used.
     In this way, an `APP_BASE_HREF` with an authority will cause all links created by Angular to ignore the `<base href>` value.

   - A fragment in the `<base href>` is _never_ persisted

For more complete information on how `<base href>` is used to construct target URIs, see the [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.2) section on transforming references.

### `HashLocationStrategy`

Use `HashLocationStrategy` by providing the `useHash: true` in an object as the second argument of the `RouterModule.forRoot()` in the `AppModule`.

```ts
providers: [
  provideRouter(appRoutes, withHashLocation())
]
```

When using `RouterModule.forRoot`, this is configured with the `useHash: true` in the second argument: `RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {useHash: true})`.

Routing helps you change what the user sees in a single-page app.
</docs-decorative-header>

In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.

As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different views that you have defined.

To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular **`Router`**.
The **`Router`** enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.

# Router reference

The following sections highlight some core router concepts.

## Router imports

The Angular Router is an optional service that presents a particular component view for a given URL.
It isn't part of the Angular core and thus is in its own library package, `@angular/router`.

Import what you need from it as you would from any other Angular package.

```ts
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
```

HELPFUL: For more on browser URL styles, see [`LocationStrategy` and browser URL styles](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#browser-url-styles).

## Configuration

A routed Angular application has one singleton instance of the `Router` service.
When the browser's URL changes, that router looks for a corresponding `Route` from which it can determine the component to display.

A router has no routes until you configure it.
The following example creates five route definitions, configures the router via the `provideRouter` method, and adds the result to the `providers` array of the `ApplicationConfig`'.

```ts
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  { path: 'crisis-center', component: CrisisListComponent },
  { path: 'hero/:id',      component: HeroDetailComponent },
  {
    path: 'heroes',
    component: HeroListComponent,
    data: { title: 'Heroes List' }
  },
  { path: '',
    redirectTo: '/heroes',
    pathMatch: 'full'
  },
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
];
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [provideRouter(appRoutes, withDebugTracing())]
}
```

The `routes` array of routes describes how to navigate.
Pass it to the `provideRouter` method in the `ApplicationConfig` `providers` to configure the router.

Each `Route` maps a URL `path` to a component.
There are no leading slashes in the path.
The router parses and builds the final URL for you, which lets you use both relative and absolute paths when navigating between application views.

The `:id` in the second route is a token for a route parameter.
In a URL such as `/hero/42`, "42" is the value of the `id` parameter.
The corresponding `HeroDetailComponent` uses that value to find and present the hero whose `id` is 42.

The `data` property in the third route is a place to store arbitrary data associated with this specific route.
The data property is accessible within each activated route.
Use it to store items such as page titles, breadcrumb text, and other read-only, static data.
Use the resolve guard to retrieve dynamic data.

The empty path in the fourth route represents the default path for the application —the place to go when the path in the URL is empty, as it typically is at the start.
This default route redirects to the route for the `/heroes` URL and, therefore, displays the `HeroesListComponent`.

If you need to see what events are happening during the navigation lifecycle, there is the `withDebugTracing` feature.
This outputs each router event that took place during each navigation lifecycle to the browser console.
Use `withDebugTracing` only for debugging purposes.
You set the `withDebugTracing` option in the object passed as the second argument to the `provideRouter` method.

## Router outlet

The `RouterOutlet` is a directive from the router library that is used like a component.
It acts as a placeholder that marks the spot in the template where the router should display the components for that outlet.

<docs-code language="html">

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- Routed components go here -->

</docs-code>

Given the preceding configuration, when the browser URL for this application becomes `/heroes`, the router matches that URL to the route path `/heroes` and displays the `HeroListComponent` as a sibling element to the `RouterOutlet` that you've placed in the host component's template.

## Router links

To navigate as a result of some user action such as the click of an anchor tag, use `RouterLink`.

Consider the following template:

<docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router/src/app/app.component.1.html"/>

The `RouterLink` directives on the anchor tags give the router control over those elements.
The navigation paths are fixed, so you can assign a string as a one-time binding to the `routerLink`.

Had the navigation path been more dynamic, you could have bound to a template expression that returned an array of route link parameters; that is, the [link parameters array](guide/routing/common-router-tasks#link-parameters-array).
The router resolves that array into a complete URL.

## Active router links

The `RouterLinkActive` directive toggles CSS classes for active `RouterLink` bindings based on the current `RouterState`.

On each anchor tag, you see a [property binding](guide/templates/property-binding) to the `RouterLinkActive` directive that looks like

<docs-code hideCopy language="html">

routerLinkActive="..."

</docs-code>

The template expression to the right of the equal sign, `=`, contains a space-delimited string of CSS classes that the Router adds when this link is active and removes when the link is inactive.
You set the `RouterLinkActive` directive to a string of classes such as `routerLinkActive="active fluffy"` or bind it to a component property that returns such a string.
For example,

<docs-code hideCopy language="typescript">

[routerLinkActive]="someStringProperty"

</docs-code>

Active route links cascade down through each level of the route tree, so parent and child router links can be active at the same time.
To override this behavior, bind to the `[routerLinkActiveOptions]` input binding with the `{ exact: true }` expression.
By using `{ exact: true }`, a given `RouterLink` is only active if its URL is an exact match to the current URL.

`RouterLinkActive` also allows you to easily apply the `aria-current` attribute to the active element, thus providing a more accessible experience for all users. For more information see the Accessibility Best Practices [Active links identification section](/best-practices/a11y#active-links-identification).

## Router state

After the end of each successful navigation lifecycle, the router builds a tree of `ActivatedRoute` objects that make up the current state of the router.
You can access the current `RouterState` from anywhere in the application using the `Router` service and the `routerState` property.

Each `ActivatedRoute` in the `RouterState` provides methods to traverse up and down the route tree to get information from parent, child, and sibling routes.

## Activated route

The route path and parameters are available through an injected router service called the [ActivatedRoute](api/router/ActivatedRoute).
It has a great deal of useful information including:

| Property        | Details |
|:---             |:---     |
| `url`           | An `Observable` of the route paths, represented as an array of strings for each part of the route path.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `data`          | An `Observable` that contains the `data` object provided for the route. Also contains any resolved values from the resolve guard.                                                                                     |
| `params`        | An `Observable` that contains the required and optional parameters specific to the route.                                                                                                                 |
| `paramMap`      | An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the required and optional parameters specific to the route. The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the same parameter. |
| `queryParamMap` | An `Observable` that contains a [map](api/router/ParamMap) of the query parameters available to all routes. The map supports retrieving single and multiple values from the query parameter.                       |
| `queryParams`   | An `Observable` that contains the query parameters available to all routes.                                                                                                                                        |
| `fragment`      | An `Observable` of the URL fragment available to all routes.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `outlet`        | The name of the `RouterOutlet` used to render the route. For an unnamed outlet, the outlet name is primary.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `routeConfig`   | The route configuration used for the route that contains the origin path.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `parent`        | The route's parent `ActivatedRoute` when this route is a child route.                                                                                                                                       |
| `firstChild`    | Contains the first `ActivatedRoute` in the list of this route's child routes.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `children`      | Contains all the child routes activated under the current route.                                                                                                                                            |

## Router events

During each navigation, the `Router` emits navigation events through the `Router.events` property.
These events are shown in the following table.

| Router event                                              | Details |
|:---                                                       |:---     |
| [`NavigationStart`](api/router/NavigationStart)           | Triggered when navigation starts.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [`RouteConfigLoadStart`](api/router/RouteConfigLoadStart) | Triggered before the `Router` lazy loads a route configuration.                                                                     |
| [`RouteConfigLoadEnd`](api/router/RouteConfigLoadEnd)     | Triggered after a route has been lazy loaded.                                                                                                                                         |
| [`RoutesRecognized`](api/router/RoutesRecognized)         | Triggered when the Router parses the URL and the routes are recognized.                                                                                                               |

| [`NavigationCancel`](api/router/NavigationCancel)         | Triggered when navigation is canceled. This can happen when a Route Guard returns false during navigation, or redirects by returning a `UrlTree` or `RedirectCommand`. |
| [`NavigationError`](api/router/NavigationError)           | Triggered when navigation fails due to an unexpected error.                                                                                                                           |
| [`Scroll`](api/router/Scroll)                             | Represents a scrolling event.                                                                                                                                                         |

When you enable the `withDebugTracing` feature, Angular logs these events to the console.

## Router terminology

Here are the key `Router` terms and their meanings:

| Router part           | Details |
|:---                   |:---     |
| `Router`              | Displays the application component for the active URL. Manages navigation from one component to the next.                                                                                        |
| `provideRouter`       | provides the necessary service providers for navigating through application views.                                                                                        |
| `RouterModule`        | A separate NgModule that provides the necessary service providers and directives for navigating through application views.                                                                       |
| `Routes`              | Defines an array of Routes, each mapping a URL path to a component.                                                                                                                              |
| `Route`               | Defines how the router should navigate to a component based on a URL pattern. Most routes consist of a path and a component type.                                                                |
| `RouterOutlet`        | The directive \(`<router-outlet>`\) that marks where the router displays a view.                                                                                                                 |
| `RouterLink`          | The directive for binding a clickable HTML element to a route. Clicking an element with a `routerLink` directive that's bound to a *string* or a *link parameters array* triggers a navigation. |
| `RouterLinkActive`    | The directive for adding/removing classes from an HTML element when an associated `routerLink` contained on or inside the element becomes active/inactive. It can also set the `aria-current` of an active link for better accessibility.                                       |
| `ActivatedRoute`      | A service that's provided to each route component that contains route specific information such as route parameters, static data, resolve data, global query parameters, and the global fragment.   |
| `RouterState`         | The current state of the router including a tree of the currently activated routes together with convenience methods for traversing the route tree.                                              |
| Link parameters array | An array that the router interprets as a routing instruction. You can bind that array to a `RouterLink` or pass the array as an argument to the `Router.navigate` method.                        |
| Routing component     | An Angular component with a `RouterOutlet` that displays views based on router navigations.                                                                                                      |

# Using Angular routes in a single-page application

This tutorial describes how to build a single-page application, SPA that uses multiple Angular routes.

In a Single Page Application \(SPA\), all of your application's functions exist in a single HTML page.
As users access your application's features, the browser needs to render only the parts that matter to the user, instead of loading a new page.
This pattern can significantly improve your application's user experience.

To define how users navigate through your application, you use routes.
Add routes to define how users navigate from one part of your application to another.
You can also configure routes to guard against unexpected or unauthorized behavior.

## Objectives

* Organize a sample application's features into modules.
* Define how to navigate to a component.
* Pass information to a component using a parameter.
* Structure routes by nesting several routes.
* Check whether users can access a route.
* Control whether the application can discard unsaved changes.
* Improve performance by pre-fetching route data and lazy loading feature modules.
* Require specific criteria to load components.

## Create a sample application

Using the Angular CLI, create a new application, *angular-router-sample*.
This application will have two components: *crisis-list* and *heroes-list*.

1. Create a new Angular project, *angular-router-sample*.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng new angular-router-sample
    </docs-code>

    When prompted with `Would you like to add Angular routing?`, select `N`.

    When prompted with `Which stylesheet format would you like to use?`, select `CSS`.

    After a few moments, a new project, `angular-router-sample`, is ready.

1. From your terminal, navigate to the `angular-router-sample` directory.
1. Create a component, *crisis-list*.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng generate component crisis-list
    </docs-code>

1. In your code editor, locate the file, `crisis-list.component.html` and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/crisis-list/crisis-list.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/crisis-list/crisis-list.component.html"/>

1. Create a second component, *heroes-list*.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng generate component heroes-list
    </docs-code>

1. In your code editor, locate the file, `heroes-list.component.html` and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/heroes-list/heroes-list.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/heroes-list/heroes-list.component.html"/>

1. In your code editor, open the file, `app.component.html` and replace its contents with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="setup"/>

1. Verify that your new application runs as expected by running the `ng serve` command.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng serve
    </docs-code>

1. Open a browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

    You should see a single web page, consisting of a title and the HTML of your two components.

## Define your routes

In this section, you'll define two routes:

* The route `/crisis-center` opens the `crisis-center` component.
* The route `/heroes-list` opens the `heroes-list` component.

A route definition is a JavaScript object.
Each route typically has two properties.
The first property, `path`, is a string that specifies the URL path for the route.
The second property, `component`, is a string that specifies what component your application should display for that path.

1. From your code editor, create and open the `app.routes.ts` file.
1. Create and export a routes list for your application:

    ```ts
    import {Routes} from '@angular/router';

    export const routes = [];
    ```

1. Add two routes for your first two components:

    ```ts
    {path: 'crisis-list', component: CrisisListComponent},
    {path: 'heroes-list', component: HeroesListComponent},
    ```

This routes list is an array of JavaScript objects, with each object defining the properties of a route.

## Import `provideRouter` from `@angular/router`

Routing lets you display specific views of your application depending on the URL path.
To add this functionality to your sample application, you need to update the `app.config.ts` file to use the router providers function, `provideRouter`.
You import this provider function from `@angular/router`.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.config.ts` file.
1. Add the following import statements:

    ```ts
    import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
    import { routes } from './app.routes';
    ```

1. Update the providers in the `appConfig`:

    ```ts
    providers: [provideRouter(routes)]
    ```

For `NgModule` based applications, put the `provideRouter` in the `providers` list of the `AppModule`, or whichever module is passed to `bootstrapModule` in the application.

## Update your component with `router-outlet`

At this point, you have defined two routes for your application.
However, your application still has both the `crisis-list` and `heroes-list` components hard-coded in your `app.component.html` template.
For your routes to work, you need to update your template to dynamically load a component based on the URL path.

To implement this functionality, you add the `router-outlet` directive to your template file.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.component.html` file.
1. Delete the following lines.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="components"/>

1. Add the `router-outlet` directive.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="router-outlet"/>

1. Add `RouterOutlet` to the imports of the `AppComponent` in `app.component.ts`

    ```ts
    imports: [RouterOutlet],
    ```

View your updated application in your browser.
You should see only the application title.
To view the `crisis-list` component, add `crisis-list` to the end of the path in your browser's address bar.
For example:

<docs-code language="http">
http://localhost:4200/crisis-list
</docs-code>

Notice that the `crisis-list` component displays.
Angular is using the route you defined to dynamically load the component.
You can load the `heroes-list` component the same way:

<docs-code language="http">
http://localhost:4200/heroes-list
</docs-code>

## Control navigation with UI elements

Currently, your application supports two routes.
However, the only way to use those routes is for the user to manually type the path in the browser's address bar.
In this section, you'll add two links that users can click to navigate between the `heroes-list` and `crisis-list` components.
You'll also add some CSS styles.
While these styles are not required, they make it easier to identify the link for the currently-displayed component.
You'll add that functionality in the next section.

1. Open the `app.component.html` file and add the following HTML below the title.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="nav"/>

    This HTML uses an Angular directive, `routerLink`.
    This directive connects the routes you defined to your template files.

1. Add the `RouterLink` directive to the imports list of `AppComponent` in `app.component.ts`.

1. Open the `app.component.css` file and add the following styles.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.css" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.css"/>

If you view your application in the browser, you should see these two links.
When you click on a link, the corresponding component appears.

## Identify the active route

While users can navigate your application using the links you added in the previous section, they don't have a straightforward way to identify what the active route is.
Add this functionality using Angular's `routerLinkActive` directive.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.component.html` file.
1. Update the anchor tags to include the `routerLinkActive` directive.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="routeractivelink"/>
1. Add the `RouterLinkActive` directive to the `imports` list of `AppComponent` in `app.component.ts`.

View your application again.
As you click one of the buttons, the style for that button updates automatically, identifying the active component to the user.
By adding the `routerLinkActive` directive, you inform your application to apply a specific CSS class to the active route.
In this tutorial, that CSS class is `activebutton`, but you could use any class that you want.

Note that we are also specifying a value for the `routerLinkActive`'s `ariaCurrentWhenActive`. This makes sure that visually impaired users (which may not perceive the different styling being applied) can also identify the active button. For more information see the Accessibility Best Practices [Active links identification section](/best-practices/a11y#active-links-identification).

## Adding a redirect

In this step of the tutorial, you add a route that redirects the user to display the `/heroes-list` component.

1. From your code editor, open the `app.routes.ts` file.
1. Update the `routes` section as follows.

    ```ts
    {path: '', redirectTo: '/heroes-list', pathMatch: 'full'},
    ```

    Notice that this new route uses an empty string as its path.
    In addition, it replaces the `component` property with two new ones:

    | Properties   | Details |
    |:---        |:---    |
    | `redirectTo` | This property instructs Angular to redirect from an empty path to the `heroes-list` path.                                                                                                                                                       |
    | `pathMatch`  | This property instructs Angular on how much of the URL to match. For this tutorial, you should set this property to `full`. This strategy is recommended when you have an empty string for a path. For more information about this property, see the [Route API documentation](api/router/Route). |

Now when you open your application, it displays the `heroes-list` component by default.

## Adding a 404 page

It is possible for a user to try to access a route that you have not defined.
To account for this behavior, the best practice is to display a 404 page.
In this section, you'll create a 404 page and update your route configuration to show that page for any unspecified routes.

1. From the terminal, create a new component, `PageNotFound`.

    <docs-code language="shell">
    ng generate component page-not-found
    </docs-code>

1. From your code editor, open the `page-not-found.component.html` file and replace its contents with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/page-not-found/page-not-found.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/router-tutorial/src/app/page-not-found/page-not-found.component.html"/>

1. Open the `app.routes.ts` file and add the following route to the routes list:

    ```ts
    {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
    ```

    The new route uses a path, `**`.
    This path is how Angular identifies a wildcard route.
    Any route that does not match an existing route in your configuration will use this route.

IMPORTANT: Notice that the wildcard route is placed at the end of the array.
The order of your routes is important, as Angular applies routes in order and uses the first match it finds.

Try navigating to a non-existing route on your application, such as `http://localhost:4200/powers`.
This route doesn't match anything defined in your `app.routes.ts` file.
However, because you defined a wildcard route, the application automatically displays your `PageNotFound` component.

## Next steps

At this point, you have a basic application that uses Angular's routing feature to change what components the user can see based on the URL address.
You have extended these features to include a redirect, as well as a wildcard route to display a custom 404 page.

# Creating custom route matches

The Angular Router supports a powerful matching strategy that you can use to help users navigate your application.
This matching strategy supports static routes, variable routes with parameters, wildcard routes, and so on.
Also, build your own custom pattern matching for situations in which the URLs are more complicated.

In this tutorial, you'll build a custom route matcher using Angular's `UrlMatcher`.
This matcher looks for a Twitter handle in the URL.

## Objectives

Implement Angular's `UrlMatcher` to create a custom route matcher.

## Create a sample application

Using the Angular CLI, create a new application, *angular-custom-route-match*.
In addition to the default Angular application framework, you will also create a *profile* component.

1. Create a new Angular project, *angular-custom-route-match*.

    ```shell
    ng new angular-custom-route-match
    ```

    When prompted with `Would you like to add Angular routing?`, select `Y`.

    When prompted with `Which stylesheet format would you like to use?`, select `CSS`.

    After a few moments, a new project, `angular-custom-route-match`, is ready.

1. From your terminal, navigate to the `angular-custom-route-match` directory.
1. Create a component, *profile*.

    ```shell
    ng generate component profile
    ```

1. In your code editor, locate the file, `profile.component.html` and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/profile/profile.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/routing-with-urlmatcher/src/app/profile/profile.component.html"/>

1. In your code editor, locate the file, `app.component.html` and replace the placeholder content with the following HTML.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/routing-with-urlmatcher/src/app/app.component.html"/>

## Configure your routes for your application

With your application framework in place, you next need to add routing capabilities to the `app.config.ts` file.
As a part of this process, you will create a custom URL matcher that looks for a Twitter handle in the URL.
This handle is identified by a preceding `@` symbol.

1. In your code editor, open your `app.config.ts` file.
1. Add an `import` statement for Angular's `provideRouter` and `withComponentInputBinding` as well as the application routes.

    ```ts
    import {provideRouter, withComponentInputBinding} from '@angular/router';

    import {routes} from './app.routes';
    ```

1. In the providers array, add a `provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())` statement.

1. Define the custom route matcher by adding the following code to the application routes.

    <docs-code header="src/app/app.routes.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/routing-with-urlmatcher/src/app/app.routes.ts" visibleRegion="matcher"/>

This custom matcher is a function that performs the following tasks:

* The matcher verifies that the array contains only one segment
* The matcher employs a regular expression to ensure that the format of the username is a match
* If there is a match, the function returns the entire URL, defining a `username` route parameter as a substring of the path
* If there isn't a match, the function returns null and the router continues to look for other routes that match the URL

HELPFUL: A custom URL matcher behaves like any other route definition. Define child routes or lazy loaded routes as you would with any other route.

## Reading the route parameters

With the custom matcher in place, you can now bind the route parameter in the `profile` component.

In your code editor, open your `profile.component.ts` file and create an `Input` matching the `username` parameter.
We added the `withComponentInputBinding` feature earlier
in `provideRouter`. This allows the `Router` to bind information directly to the route components.

```ts
@Input() username!: string;
```

## Test your custom URL matcher

With your code in place, you can now test your custom URL matcher.

1. From a terminal window, run the `ng serve` command.

    <docs-code language="shell">

# Dependent state with `linkedSignal`

You can use the `signal` function to hold some state in your Angular code. Sometimes, this state depends on some _other_ state. For example, imagine a component that lets the user select a shipping method for an order:

```typescript
@Component({/* ... */})
export class ShippingMethodPicker {
  shippingOptions: Signal<ShippingMethod[]> = getShippingOptions();

  // Select the first shipping option by default.
  selectedOption = signal(this.shippingOptions()[0]);

  changeShipping(newOptionIndex: number) {
    this.selectedOption.set(this.shippingOptions()[newOptionIndex]);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `selectedOption` defaults to the first option, but changes if the user selects another option. But `shippingOptions` is a signal— its value may change! If `shippingOptions` changes, `selectedOption` may contain a value that is no longer a valid option.

**The `linkedSignal` function lets you create a signal to hold some state that is intrinsically _linked_ to some other state.** Revisiting the example above, `linkedSignal` can replace `signal`:

```typescript
@Component({/* ... */})
export class ShippingMethodPicker {
  shippingOptions: Signal<ShippingMethod[]> = getShippingOptions();

  // Initialize selectedOption to the first shipping option.
  selectedOption = linkedSignal(() => this.shippingOptions()[0]);

  changeShipping(index: number) {
    this.selectedOption.set(this.shippingOptions()[index]);
  }
}
```

`linkedSignal` works similarly to `signal` with one key difference— instead of passing a default value, you pass a _computation function_, just like `computed`. When the value of the computation changes, the value of the `linkedSignal` changes to the computation result. This helps ensure that the `linkedSignal` always has a valid value.

The following example shows how the value of a `linkedSignal` can change based on its linked state:

```typescript
const shippingOptions = signal(['Ground', 'Air', 'Sea']);
const selectedOption = linkedSignal(() => shippingOptions()[0]);
console.log(selectedOption()); // 'Ground'

selectedOption.set(shippingOptions()[2]);
console.log(selectedOption()); // 'Sea'

shippingOptions.set(['Email', 'Will Call', 'Postal service']);
console.log(selectedOption()); // 'Email'
```

## Accounting for previous state

In some cases, the computation for a `linkedSignal` needs to account for the previous value of the `linkedSignal`.

In the example above, `selectedOption` always updates back to the first option when `shippingOptions` changes. You may, however, want to preserve the user's selection if their selected option is still somewhere in the list. To accomplish this, you can create a `linkedSignal` with a separate _source_ and _computation_:

```typescript
interface ShippingMethod {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

@Component({/* ... */})
export class ShippingMethodPicker {
  constructor() {
    this.changeShipping(2);
    this.changeShippingOptions();
    console.log(this.selectedOption()); // {"id":2,"name":"Postal Service"}
  }

  shippingOptions = signal<ShippingMethod[]>([
    { id: 0, name: 'Ground' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Air' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Sea' },
  ]);

  selectedOption = linkedSignal<ShippingMethod[], ShippingMethod>({
    // `selectedOption` is set to the `computation` result whenever this `source` changes.
    source: this.shippingOptions,
    computation: (newOptions, previous) => {
      // If the newOptions contain the previously selected option, preserve that selection.
      // Otherwise, default to the first option.
      return (
        newOptions.find((opt) => opt.id === previous?.value.id) ?? newOptions[0]
      );
    },
  });

  changeShipping(index: number) {
    this.selectedOption.set(this.shippingOptions()[index]);
  }

  changeShippingOptions() {
    this.shippingOptions.set([
      { id: 0, name: 'Email' },
      { id: 1, name: 'Sea' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Postal Service' },
    ]);
  }
}
```

When you create a `linkedSignal`, you can pass an object with separate `source` and `computation` properties instead of providing just a computation.

The `source` can be any signal, such as a `computed` or component `input`. When the value of `source` changes, `linkedSignal` updates its value to the result of the provided `computation`.

The `computation` is a function that receives the new value of `source` and a `previous` object. The `previous` object has two properties— `previous.source` is the previous value of `source`, and `previous.value` is the previous result of the `computation`. You can use these previous values to decide the new result of the computation.

## Custom equality comparison

`linkedSignal`, as any other signal, can be configured with a custom equality function. This function is used by downstream dependencies to determine if that value of the `linkedSignal` (result of a computation) changed:

```typescript
const activeUser = signal({id: 123, name: 'Morgan', isAdmin: true});

const activeUserEditCopy = linkedSignal(() => activeUser(), {
  // Consider the user as the same if it's the same `id`.
  equal: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
});

// Or, if separating `source` and `computation`
const activeUserEditCopy = linkedSignal({
  source: activeUser,
  computation: user => user,
  equal: (a, b) => a.id === b.id,
});
```

<docs-decorative-header title="Angular Signals" imgSrc="adev/src/assets/images/signals.svg"> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
Angular Signals is a system that granularly tracks how and where your state is used throughout an application, allowing the framework to optimize rendering updates.
</docs-decorative-header>

TIP: Check out Angular's [Essentials](essentials/signals) before diving into this comprehensive guide.

## What are signals?

A **signal** is a wrapper around a value that notifies interested consumers when that value changes. Signals can contain any value, from primitives to complex data structures.

You read a signal's value by calling its getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.

Signals may be either _writable_ or _read-only_.

### Writable signals

Writable signals provide an API for updating their values directly. You create writable signals by calling the `signal` function with the signal's initial value:

```ts
const count = signal(0);

// Signals are getter functions - calling them reads their value.
console.log('The count is: ' + count());
```

To change the value of a writable signal, either `.set()` it directly:

```ts
count.set(3);
```

or use the `.update()` operation to compute a new value from the previous one:

```ts
// Increment the count by 1.
count.update(value => value + 1);
```

Writable signals have the type `WritableSignal`.

### Computed signals

**Computed signal** are read-only signals that derive their value from other signals. You define computed signals using the `computed` function and specifying a derivation:

```typescript
const count: WritableSignal<number> = signal(0);
const doubleCount: Signal<number> = computed(() => count() * 2);
```

The `doubleCount` signal depends on the `count` signal. Whenever `count` updates, Angular knows that `doubleCount` needs to update as well.

#### Computed signals are both lazily evaluated and memoized

`doubleCount`'s derivation function does not run to calculate its value until the first time you read `doubleCount`. The calculated value is then cached, and if you read `doubleCount` again, it will return the cached value without recalculating.

If you then change `count`, Angular knows that `doubleCount`'s cached value is no longer valid, and the next time you read `doubleCount` its new value will be calculated.

As a result, you can safely perform computationally expensive derivations in computed signals, such as filtering arrays.

#### Computed signals are not writable signals

You cannot directly assign values to a computed signal. That is,

```ts
doubleCount.set(3);
```

produces a compilation error, because `doubleCount` is not a `WritableSignal`.

#### Computed signal dependencies are dynamic

Only the signals actually read during the derivation are tracked. For example, in this `computed` the `count` signal is only read if the `showCount` signal is true:

```ts
const showCount = signal(false);
const count = signal(0);
const conditionalCount = computed(() => {
  if (showCount()) {
    return `The count is ${count()}.`;
  } else {
    return 'Nothing to see here!';
  }
});
```

When you read `conditionalCount`, if `showCount` is `false` the "Nothing to see here!" message is returned _without_ reading the `count` signal. This means that if you later update `count` it will _not_ result in a recomputation of `conditionalCount`.

If you set `showCount` to `true` and then read `conditionalCount` again, the derivation will re-execute and take the branch where `showCount` is `true`, returning the message which shows the value of `count`. Changing `count` will then invalidate `conditionalCount`'s cached value.

Note that dependencies can be removed during a derivation as well as added. If you later set `showCount` back to `false`, then `count` will no longer be considered a dependency of `conditionalCount`.

## Reading signals in `OnPush` components

When you read a signal within an `OnPush` component's template, Angular tracks the signal as a dependency of that component. When the value of that signal changes, Angular automatically [marks](api/core/ChangeDetectorRef#markforcheck) the component to ensure it gets updated the next time change detection runs. Refer to the [Skipping component subtrees](best-practices/skipping-subtrees) guide for more information about `OnPush` components.

## Effects

Signals are useful because they notify interested consumers when they change. An **effect** is an operation that runs whenever one or more signal values change. You can create an effect with the `effect` function:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`The current count is: ${count()}`);
});
```

Effects always run **at least once.** When an effect runs, it tracks any signal value reads. Whenever any of these signal values change, the effect runs again. Similar to computed signals, effects keep track of their dependencies dynamically, and only track signals which were read in the most recent execution.

Effects always execute **asynchronously**, during the change detection process.

### Use cases for effects

Effects are rarely needed in most application code, but may be useful in specific circumstances. Here are some examples of situations where an `effect` might be a good solution:

- Logging data being displayed and when it changes, either for analytics or as a debugging tool.
- Keeping data in sync with `window.localStorage`.
- Adding custom DOM behavior that can't be expressed with template syntax.
- Performing custom rendering to a `<canvas>`, charting library, or other third party UI library.

<docs-callout critical title="When not to use effects">
Avoid using effects for propagation of state changes. This can result in `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked` errors, infinite circular updates, or unnecessary change detection cycles.

Instead, use `computed` signals to model state that depends on other state.
</docs-callout>

### Injection context

By default, you can only create an `effect()` within an [injection context](guide/di/dependency-injection-context) (where you have access to the `inject` function). The easiest way to satisfy this requirement is to call `effect` within a component, directive, or service `constructor`:

```ts
@Component({...})
export class EffectiveCounterComponent {
  readonly count = signal(0);
  constructor() {
    // Register a new effect.
    effect(() => {
      console.log(`The count is: ${this.count()}`);
    });
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can assign the effect to a field (which also gives it a descriptive name).

```ts
@Component({...})
export class EffectiveCounterComponent {
  readonly count = signal(0);

  private loggingEffect = effect(() => {
    console.log(`The count is: ${this.count()}`);
  });
}
```

To create an effect outside the constructor, you can pass an `Injector` to `effect` via its options:

```ts
@Component({...})
export class EffectiveCounterComponent {
  readonly count = signal(0);
  private injector = inject(Injector);

  initializeLogging(): void {
    effect(() => {
      console.log(`The count is: ${this.count()}`);
    }, {injector: this.injector});
  }
}
```

### Destroying effects

When you create an effect, it is automatically destroyed when its enclosing context is destroyed. This means that effects created within components are destroyed when the component is destroyed. The same goes for effects within directives, services, etc.

Effects return an `EffectRef` that you can use to destroy them manually, by calling the `.destroy()` method. You can combine this with the `manualCleanup` option to create an effect that lasts until it is manually destroyed. Be careful to actually clean up such effects when they're no longer required.

## Advanced topics

### Signal equality functions

When creating a signal, you can optionally provide an equality function, which will be used to check whether the new value is actually different than the previous one.

```ts
import _ from 'lodash';

const data = signal(['test'], {equal: _.isEqual});

// Even though this is a different array instance, the deep equality
// function will consider the values to be equal, and the signal won't
// trigger any updates.
data.set(['test']);
```

Equality functions can be provided to both writable and computed signals.

HELPFUL: By default, signals use referential equality ([`Object.is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) comparison).

### Reading without tracking dependencies

Rarely, you may want to execute code which may read signals within a reactive function such as `computed` or `effect` _without_ creating a dependency.

For example, suppose that when `currentUser` changes, the value of a `counter` should be logged. you could create an `effect` which reads both signals:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to ${currentUser()} and the counter is ${counter()}`);
});
```

This example will log a message when _either_ `currentUser` or `counter` changes. However, if the effect should only run when `currentUser` changes, then the read of `counter` is only incidental and changes to `counter` shouldn't log a new message.

You can prevent a signal read from being tracked by calling its getter with `untracked`:

```ts
effect(() => {
  console.log(`User set to ${currentUser()} and the counter is ${untracked(counter)}`);
});
```

`untracked` is also useful when an effect needs to invoke some external code which shouldn't be treated as a dependency:

```ts
effect(() => {
  const user = currentUser();
  untracked(() => {
    // If the `loggingService` reads signals, they won't be counted as
    // dependencies of this effect.
    this.loggingService.log(`User set to ${user}`);
  });
});
```

### Effect cleanup functions

Effects might start long-running operations, which you should cancel if the effect is destroyed or runs again before the first operation finished. When you create an effect, your function can optionally accept an `onCleanup` function as its first parameter. This `onCleanup` function lets you register a callback that is invoked before the next run of the effect begins, or when the effect is destroyed.

```ts
effect((onCleanup) => {
  const user = currentUser();

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`1 second ago, the user became ${user}`);
  }, 1000);

  onCleanup(() => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  });
});
```

## Using signals with RxJS

See [RxJS interop with Angular signals](ecosystem/rxjs-interop) for details on interoperability between signals and RxJS.

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/signals/resource.md
================================================
# Async reactivity with resources

IMPORTANT: `resource` is [experimental](reference/releases#experimental). It's ready for you to try, but it might change before it is stable.

Most signal APIs are synchronous— `signal`, `computed`, `input`, etc. However, applications often need to deal with data that is available asynchronously. A `Resource` gives you a way to incorporate async data into your application's signal-based code.

You can use a `Resource` to perform any kind of async operation, but the most common use-case for `Resource` is fetching data from a server. The following example creates a resource to fetch some user data.

The easiest way to create a `Resource` is the `resource` function.

```typescript
import {resource, Signal} from '@angular/core';

const userId: Signal<string> = getUserId();

const userResource = resource({
  // Define a reactive request computation.
  // The request value recomputes whenever any read signals change.
  request: () => ({id: userId()}),

  // Define an async loader that retrieves data.
  // The resource calls this function every time the `request` value changes.
  loader: ({request}) => fetchUser(request),
});

// Create a computed signal based on the result of the resource's loader function.
const firstName = computed(() => userResource.value().firstName);
```

The `resource` function accepts a `ResourceOptions` object with two main properties: `request` and `loader`.

The `request` property defines a reactive computation that produce a request value. Whenever signals read in this computation change, the resource produces a new request value, similar to `computed`.

The `loader` property defines a `ResourceLoader`— an async function that retrieves some state. The resource calls the loader every time the `request` computation produces a new value, passing that value to the loader. See [Resource loaders](#resource-loaders) below for more details.

`Resource` has a `value` signal that contains the results of the loader.

## Resource loaders

When creating a resource, you specify a `ResourceLoader`. This loader is an async function that accepts a single parameter— a `ResourceLoaderParams` object— and returns a value.

The `ResourceLoaderParams` object contains three properties: `request`, `previous`, and `abortSignal`.

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `request`     | The value of the resource's `request` computation.                                                                                               |
| `previous`    | An object with a `status` property, containing the previous `ResourceStatus`.                                                                    |
| `abortSignal` | An [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal). See [Aborting requests](#aborting-requests) below for details. |


If the `request` computation returns `undefined`, the loader function does not run and the resource status becomes `Idle`.

### Aborting requests

A resource aborts an outstanding request if the `request` computation changes while the resource is loading.

You can use the `abortSignal` in `ResourceLoaderParams` to respond to aborted requests. For example, the native `fetch` function accepts an `AbortSignal`:

```typescript
const userId: Signal<string> = getUserId();

const userResource = resource({
  request: () => ({id: userId()}),
  loader: ({request, abortSignal}): Promise<User> => {
    // fetch cancels any outstanding HTTP requests when the given `AbortSignal`
    // indicates that the request has been aborted.
    return fetch(`users/${request.id}`, {signal: abortSignal});
  },
});
```

See [`AbortSignal` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) for more details on request cancellation with `AbortSignal`.

### Reloading

You can programmatically trigger a resource's `loader` by calling the `reload` method.

```typescript
const userId: Signal<string> = getUserId();

const userResource = resource({
  request: () => ({id: userId()}),
  loader: ({request}) => fetchUser(request),
});

// ...

userResource.reload();
```

## Resource status

The resource object has several signal properties for reading the status of the asynchronous loader.

| Property    | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`     | The most recent value of the resource, or `undefined` if no value has been received.                            |
| `hasValue`  | Whether the resource has a value.                                                                               |
| `error`     | The most recent error encountered while running the resource's loader, or `undefined` if no error has occurred. |
| `isLoading` | Whether the resource loader is currently running.                                                               |
| `status`    | The resource's specific `ResourceStatus`, as described below.                                                   |

The `status` signal provides a specific `ResourceStatus` that describes the state of the resource.

| Status      | `value()`         | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | :---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Idle`      | `undefined`       | The resource has no valid request and the loader has not run.                |
| `Error`     | `undefined`       | The loader has encountered an error.                                         |
| `Loading`   | `undefined`       | The loader is running as a result of the `request` value changing.           |
| `Reloading` | Previous value    | The loader is running as a result calling of the resource's `reload` method. |
| `Resolved`  | Resolved value    | The loader has completed.                                                    |
| `Local`     | Locally set value | The resource's value has been set locally via `.set()` or `.update()`        |

You can use this status information to conditionally display user interface elements, such loading indicators and error messages.

================================================
# Binding dynamic text, properties and attributes

In Angular, a **binding** creates a dynamic connection between a component's template and its data. This connection ensures that changes to the component's data automatically update the rendered template.

## Render dynamic text with text interpolation

You can bind dynamic text in templates with double curly braces, which tells Angular that it is responsible for the expression inside and ensuring it is updated correctly. This is called **text interpolation**.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <p>Your color preference is {{ theme }}.</p>
  `,
  ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  theme = 'dark';
}
```

In this example, when the snippet is rendered to the page, Angular will replace `{{ theme }}` with `dark`.

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered Output -->
<p>Your color preference is dark.</p>
```

In addition to evaluating the expression at first render, Angular also updates the rendered content when the expression's value changes.

Continuing the theme example, if a user clicks on a button that changes the value of `theme` to `'light'` after the page loads, the page updates accordingly to:

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered Output -->
<p>Your color preference is light.</p>
```

You can use text interpolation anywhere you would normally write text in HTML.

All expression values are converted to a string. Objects and arrays are converted using the value’s `toString` method.

## Binding dynamic properties and attributes

Angular supports binding dynamic values into object properties and HTML attributes with square brackets.

You can bind to properties on an HTML element's DOM instance, a [component](guide/components) instance, or a [directive](guide/directives) instance.

### Native element properties

Every HTML element has a corresponding DOM representation. For example, each `<button>` HTML element corresponds to an instance of `HTMLButtonElement` in the DOM. In Angular, you use property bindings to set values directly to the DOM representation of the element.

```angular-html
<!-- Bind the `disabled` property on the button element's DOM object -->
<button [disabled]="isFormValid">Save</button>
```

In this example, every time `isFormValid` changes, Angular automatically sets the `disabled` property of the `HTMLButtonElement` instance.

### Component and directive properties

When an element is an Angular component, you can use property bindings to set component input properties using the same square bracket syntax.

```angular-html
<!-- Bind the `value` property on the `MyListbox` component instance. -->
<my-listbox [value]="mySelection" />
```

In this example, every time `mySelection` changes, Angular automatically sets the `value` property of the `MyListbox` instance.

You can bind to directive properties as well.

```angular-html
<!-- Bind to the `ngSrc` property of the `NgOptimizedImage` directive  -->
<img [ngSrc]="profilePhotoUrl" alt="The current user's profile photo">
```

### Attributes

When you need to set HTML attributes that do not have corresponding DOM properties, such as ARIA attributes or SVG attributes, you can bind attributes to elements in your template with the `attr.` prefix.

```angular-html
<!-- Bind the `role` attribute on the `<ul>` element to the component's `listRole` property. -->
<ul [attr.role]="listRole">
```

In this example, every time `listRole` changes, Angular automatically sets the `role` attribute of the `<ul>` element by calling `setAttribute`.

If the value of an attribute binding is `null`, Angular removes the attribute by calling `removeAttribute`.

### Text interpolation in properties and attributes

You can also use text interpolation syntax in properties and attributes by using the double curly brace syntax instead of square braces around the property or attribute name. When using this syntax, Angular treats the assignment as a property binding.

```angular-html
<!-- Binds a value to the `alt` property of the image element's DOM object. -->
<img src="profile-photo.jpg" alt="Profile photo of {{ firstName }}" >
```

To bind to an attribute with the text interpolation syntax, prefix the attribute name with `attr.`

```angular-html
<button attr.aria-label="Save changes to {{ objectType }}">
```

## CSS class and style property bindings

Angular supports additional features for binding CSS classes and CSS style properties to elements.

### CSS classes

You can create a CSS class binding to conditionally add or remove a CSS class on an element based on whether the bound value is [truthy or falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy).

```angular-html
<!-- When `isExpanded` is truthy, add the `expanded` CSS class. -->
<ul [class.expanded]="isExpanded">
```

You can also bind directly to the `class` property. Angular accepts three types of value:

| Description of `class` value                                                                                                                                      | TypeScript type       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| A string containing one or more CSS classes separated by spaces                                                                                                   | `string`              |
| An array of CSS class strings                                                                                                                                     | `string[]`            |
| An object where each property name is a CSS class name and each corresponding value determines whether that class is applied to the element, based on truthiness. | `Record<string, any>` |

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ul [class]="listClasses"> ... </ul>
    <section [class]="sectionClasses"> ... </section>
    <button [class]="buttonClasses"> ... </button>
  `,
  ...
})
export class UserProfile {
  listClasses = 'full-width outlined';
  sectionClasses = ['expandable', 'elevated'];
  buttonClasses = {
    highlighted: true,
    embiggened: false,
  };
}
```

The above example renders the following DOM:

```angular-html
<ul class="full-width outlined"> ... </ul>
<section class="expandable elevated"> ... </section>
<button class="highlighted"> ... </button>
```

Angular ignores any string values that are not valid CSS class names.

When using static CSS classes, directly binding `class`, and binding specific classes, Angular intelligently combines all of the classes in the rendered result.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `<ul class="list" [class]="listType" [class.expanded]="isExpanded"> ...`,
  ...
})
export class Listbox {
  listType = 'box';
  isExpanded = true;
}
```

In the example above, Angular renders the `ul` element with all three CSS classes.

```angular-html
<ul class="list box expanded">
```

Angular does not guarantee any specific order of CSS classes on rendered elements.

When binding `class` to an array or an object, Angular compares the previous value to the current value with the triple-equals operator (`===`). You must create a new object or array instance when you modify these values in order for Angular to apply any updates.

If an element has multiple bindings for the same CSS class, Angular resolves collisions by following its style precedence order.

### CSS style properties

You can also bind to CSS style properties directly on an element.

```angular-html
<!-- Set the CSS `display` property based on the `isExpanded` property. -->
<section [style.display]="isExpanded ? 'block' : 'none'">
```

You can further specify units for CSS properties that accept units.

```angular-html
<!-- Set the CSS `height` property to a pixel value based on the `sectionHeightInPixels` property. -->
<section [style.height.px]="sectionHeightInPixels">
```

You can also set multiple style values in one binding. Angular accepts the following types of value:

| Description of `style` value                                                                                              | TypeScript type       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| A string containing zero or more CSS declarations, such as `"display: flex; margin: 8px"`.                                | `string`              |
| An object where each property name is a CSS property name and each corresponding value is the value of that CSS property. | `Record<string, any>` |

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ul [style]="listStyles"> ... </ul>
    <section [style]="sectionStyles"> ... </section>
  `,
  ...
})
export class UserProfile {
  listStyles = 'display: flex; padding: 8px';
  sectionStyles = {
    border: '1px solid black',
    'font-weight': 'bold',
  };
}
```

The above example renders the following DOM.

```angular-html
<ul style="display: flex; padding: 8px"> ... </ul>
<section style="border: 1px solid black; font-weight: bold"> ... </section>
```

When binding `style` to an object, Angular compares the previous value to the current value with the triple-equals operator (`===`). You must create a new object instance when you modify these values in order to Angular to apply any updates.

If an element has multiple bindings for the same style property, Angular resolves collisions by following its style precedence order.

================================================
# Control flow

Angular templates support control flow blocks that let you conditionally show, hide, and repeat elements.

NOTE: This was previously accomplished with the *ngIf, *ngFor, and \*ngSwitch directives.

## Conditionally display content with `@if`, `@else-if` and `@else`

The `@if` block conditionally displays its content when its condition expression is truthy:

```angular-html
@if (a > b) {
  <p>{{a}} is greater than {{b}}</p>
}
```

If you want to display alternative content, you can do so by providing any number of `@else if` blocks and a singular `@else` block.

```angular-html
@if (a > b) {
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}
} @else if (b > a) {
  {{a}} is less than {{b}}
} @else {
  {{a}} is equal to {{b}}
}
```

### Referencing the conditional expression's result

The `@if` conditional supports saving the result of the conditional expression into a variable for reuse inside of the block.

```angular-html
@if (user.profile.settings.startDate; as startDate) {
  {{ startDate }}
}
```

This can be useful for referencing longer expressions that would be easier to read and maintain within the template.

## Repeat content with the `@for` block

The `@for` block loops through a collection and repeatedly renders the content of a block. The collection can be any JavaScript [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), but Angular has additional performance optimizations for `Array` values.

A typical `@for` loop looks like:

```angular-html
@for (item of items; track item.id) {
  {{ item.name }}
}
```

Angular's `@for` block does not support flow-modifying statements like JavaScript's `continue` or `break`.

### Why is `track` in `@for` blocks important?

The `track` expression allows Angular to maintain a relationship between your data and the DOM nodes on the page. This allows Angular to optimize performance by executing the minimum necessary DOM operations when the data changes.

Using track effectively can significantly improve your application's rendering performance when looping over data collections.

Select a property that uniquely identifies each item in the `track` expression. If your data model includes a uniquely identifying property, commonly `id` or `uuid`, use this value. If your data does not include a field like this, strongly consider adding one.

For static collections that never change, you can use `$index` to tell Angular to track each item by its index in the collection.

If no other option is available, you can specify `identity`. This tells Angular to track the item by its reference identity using the triple-equals operator (`===`). Avoid this option whenever possible as it can lead to significantly slower rendering updates, as Angular has no way to map which data item corresponds to which DOM nodes.

### Contextual variables in `@for` blocks

Inside `@for` blocks, several implicit variables are always available:

| Variable | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `$count` | Number of items in a collection iterated over |
| `$index` | Index of the current row                      |
| `$first` | Whether the current row is the first row      |
| `$last`  | Whether the current row is the last row       |
| `$even`  | Whether the current row index is even         |
| `$odd`   | Whether the current row index is odd          |

These variables are always available with these names, but can be aliased via a `let` segment:

```angular-html
@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even) {
  <p>Item #{{ idx }}: {{ item.name }}</p>
}
```

The aliasing is useful when nesting `@for` blocks, letting you read variables from the outer `@for` block from an inner `@for` block.

### Providing a fallback for `@for` blocks with the `@empty` block

You can optionally include an `@empty` section immediately after the `@for` block content. The content of the `@empty` block displays when there are no items:

```angular-html
@for (item of items; track item.name) {
  <li> {{ item.name }}</li>
} @empty {
  <li aria-hidden="true"> There are no items. </li>
}
```

## Conditionally display content with the `@switch` block

While the `@if` block is great for most scenarios, the `@switch` block provides an alternate syntax to conditionally render data. Its syntax closely resembles JavaScript's `switch` statement.

```angular-html
@switch (userPermissions) {
  @case ('admin') {
    <app-admin-dashboard />
  }
  @case ('reviewer') {
    <app-reviewer-dashboard />
  }
  @case ('editor') {
    <app-editor-dashboard />
  }
  @default {
    <app-viewer-dashboard />
  }
}
```

The value of the conditional expression is compared to the case expression using the triple-equals (`===`) operator.

**`@switch` does not have a fallthrough**, so you do not need an equivalent to a `break` or `return` statement in the block.

You can optionally include a `@default` block. The content of the `@default` block displays if none of the preceding case expressions match the switch value.

If no `@case` matches the expression and there is no `@default` block, nothing is shown.

================================================
# Deferred loading with `@defer`

Deferrable views, also known as `@defer` blocks, reduce the initial bundle size of your application by deferring the loading of code that is not strictly necessary for the initial rendering of a page. This often results in a faster initial load and improvement in Core Web Vitals (CWV), primarily Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Time to First Byte (TTFB).

To use this feature, you can declaratively wrap a section of your template in a @defer block:

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
}
```

The code for any components, directives, and pipes inside the `@defer` block is split into a separate JavaScript file and loaded only when necessary, after the rest of the template has been rendered.

Deferrable views support a variety of triggers, prefetching options, and sub-blocks for placeholder, loading, and error state management.

## Which dependencies are deferred?

Components, directives, pipes, and any component CSS styles can be deferred when loading an application.

In order for the dependencies within a `@defer` block to be deferred, they need to meet two conditions:

1. **They must be standalone.** Non-standalone dependencies cannot be deferred and are still eagerly loaded, even if they are inside of `@defer` blocks.
1. **They cannot be referenced outside of `@defer` blocks within the same file.** If they are referenced outside the `@defer` block or referenced within ViewChild queries, the dependencies will be eagerly loaded.

The _transitive_ dependencies of the components, directives and pipes used in the `@defer` block do not strictly need to be standalone; transitive dependencies can still be declared in an `NgModule` and participate in deferred loading.

Angular's compiler produces a [dynamic import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) statement for each component, directive, and pipe used in the `@defer` block. The main content of the block renders after all the imports resolve. Angular does not guarantee any particular order for these imports.

## How to manage different stages of deferred loading

`@defer` blocks have several sub blocks to allow you to gracefully handle different stages in the deferred loading process.

### `@defer`

This is the primary block that defines the section of content that is lazily loaded. It is not rendered initially– deferred content loads and renders once the specified [trigger](/guide/defer#triggers) occurs or the `when` condition is met.

By default, a @defer block is triggered when the browser state becomes [idle](/guide/defer#idle).

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
}
```

### Show placeholder content with `@placeholder`

By default, defer blocks do not render any content before they are triggered.

The `@placeholder` is an optional block that declares what content to show before the `@defer` block is triggered.

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @placeholder {
  <p>Placeholder content</p>
}
```

While optional, certain triggers may require the presence of either a `@placeholder` or a [template reference variable](/guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables) to function. See the [Triggers](/guide/defer#triggers) section for more details.

Angular replaces placeholder content with the main content once loading is complete. You can use any content in the placeholder section including plain HTML, components, directives, and pipes. Keep in mind the _dependencies of the placeholder block are eagerly loaded_.

The `@placeholder` block accepts an optional parameter to specify the `minimum` amount of time that this placeholder should be shown after the placeholder content initially renders.

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @placeholder (minimum 500ms) {
  <p>Placeholder content</p>
}
```

This `minimum` parameter is specified in time increments of milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s). You can use this parameter to prevent fast flickering of placeholder content in the case that the deferred dependencies are fetched quickly.

### Show loading content with `@loading`

The `@loading` block is an optional block that allows you to declare content that is shown while deferred dependencies are loading. It replaces the `@placeholder` block once loading is triggered.

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @loading {
  <img alt="loading..." src="loading.gif" />
} @placeholder {
  <p>Placeholder content</p>
}
```

Its dependencies are eagerly loaded (similar to `@placeholder`).

The `@loading` block accepts two optional parameters to help prevent fast flickering of content that may occur when deferred dependencies are fetched quickly,:

- `minimum` - the minimum amount of time that this placeholder should be shown
- `after` - the amount of time to wait after loading begins before showing the loading template

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @loading (after 100ms; minimum 1s) {
  <img alt="loading..." src="loading.gif" />
}
```

Both parameters are specified in time increments of milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s). In addition, the timers for both parameters begin immediately after the loading has been triggered.

### Show error state when deferred loading fails with `@error`

The `@error` block is an optional block that displays if deferred loading fails. Similar to `@placeholder` and `@loading`, the dependencies of the @error block are eagerly loaded.

```angular-html
@defer {
  <large-component />
} @error {
  <p>Failed to load large component.</p>
}
```

## Controlling deferred content loading with triggers

You can specify **triggers** that control when Angular loads and displays deferred content.

When a `@defer` block is triggered, it replaces placeholder content with lazily loaded content.

Multiple event triggers can be defined by separating them with a semicolon, `;` and will be evaluated as OR conditions.

There are two types of triggers: `on` and `when`.

### `on`

`on` specifies a condition for when the `@defer` block is triggered.

The available triggers are as follows:

| Trigger                       | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`idle`](#idle)               | Triggers when the browser is idle.                                     |
| [`viewport`](#viewport)       | Triggers when specified content enters the viewport                    |
| [`interaction`](#interaction) | Triggers when the user interacts with specified element                |
| [`hover`](#hover)             | Triggers when the mouse hovers over specified area                     |
| [`immediate`](#immediate)     | Triggers immediately after non-deferred content has finished rendering |
| [`timer`](#timer)             | Triggers after a specific duration                                     |

#### `idle`

The `idle` trigger loads the deferred content once the browser has reached an idle state, based on requestIdleCallback. This is the default behavior with a defer block.

```angular-html
<!-- @defer (on idle) -->
@defer {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `viewport`

The `viewport` trigger loads the deferred content when the specified content enters the viewport using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). Observed content may be `@placeholder` content or an explicit element reference.

By default, the `@defer` watches for the placeholder entering the viewport. Placeholders used this way must have a single root element.

```angular-html
@defer (on viewport) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify a [template reference variable](/guide/templates/variables) in the same template as the `@defer` block as the element that is watched to enter the viewport. This variable is passed in as a parameter on the viewport trigger.

```angular-html
<div #greeting>Hello!</div>
@defer (on viewport(greeting)) {
  <greetings-cmp />
}
```

#### `interaction`

The `interaction` trigger loads the deferred content when the user interacts with the specified element through `click` or `keydown` events.

By default, the placeholder acts as the interaction element. Placeholders used this way must have a single root element.

```angular-html
@defer (on interaction) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify a [template reference variable](/guide/templates/variables) in the same template as the `@defer` block as the element that is watched to enter the viewport. This variable is passed in as a parameter on the viewport trigger.

```angular-html
<div #greeting>Hello!</div>
@defer (on interaction(greeting)) {
  <greetings-cmp />
}
```

#### `hover`

The `hover` trigger loads the deferred content when the mouse has hovered over the triggered area through the `mouseover` and `focusin` events.

By default, the placeholder acts as the interaction element. Placeholders used this way must have a single root element.

```angular-html
@defer (on hover) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

Alternatively, you can specify a [template reference variable](/guide/templates/variables) in the same template as the `@defer` block as the element that is watched to enter the viewport. This variable is passed in as a parameter on the viewport trigger.

```angular-html
<div #greeting>Hello!</div>
@defer (on hover(greeting)) {
  <greetings-cmp />
}
```

#### `immediate`

The `immediate` trigger loads the deferred content immediately. This means that the deferred block loads as soon as all other non-deferred content has finished rendering.

```angular-html
@defer (on immediate) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

#### `timer`

The `timer` trigger loads the deferred content after a specified duration.

```angular-html
@defer (on timer(500ms)) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

The duration parameter must be specified in milliseconds (`ms`) or seconds (`s`).

### `when`

The `when` trigger accepts a custom conditional expression and loads the deferred content when the condition becomes truthy.

```angular-html
@defer (when condition) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

This is a one-time operation– the `@defer` block does not revert back to the placeholder if the condition changes to a falsy value after becoming truthy.

## Prefetching data with `prefetch`

In addition to specifying a condition that determines when deferred content is shown, you can optionally specify a **prefetch trigger**. This trigger lets you load the JavaScript associated with the `@defer` block before the deferred content is shown.

Prefetching enables more advanced behaviors, such as letting you start to prefetch resources before a user has actually seen or interacted with a defer block, but might interact with it soon, making the resources available faster.

You can specify a prefetch trigger similarly to the block's main trigger, but prefixed with the `prefetch` keyword. The block's main trigger and prefetch trigger are separated with a semi-colon character (`;`).

In the example below, the prefetching starts when a browser becomes idle and the contents of the block is rendered only once the user interacts with the placeholder.

```angular-html
@defer (on interaction; prefetch on idle) {
  <large-cmp />
} @placeholder {
  <div>Large component placeholder</div>
}
```

## Testing `@defer` blocks

Angular provides TestBed APIs to simplify the process of testing `@defer` blocks and triggering different states during testing. By default, `@defer` blocks in tests play through like a defer block would behave in a real application. If you want to manually step through states, you can switch the defer block behavior to `Manual` in the TestBed configuration.

```angular-ts
it('should render a defer block in different states', async () => {
  // configures the defer block behavior to start in "paused" state for manual control.
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({deferBlockBehavior: DeferBlockBehavior.Manual});
  @Component({
    // ...
    template: `
      @defer {
        <large-component />
      } @placeholder {
        Placeholder
      } @loading {
        Loading...
      }
    `
  })
  class ComponentA {}
  // Create component fixture.
  const componentFixture = TestBed.createComponent(ComponentA);
  // Retrieve the list of all defer block fixtures and get the first block.
  const deferBlockFixture = (await componentFixture.getDeferBlocks())[0];
  // Renders placeholder state by default.
  expect(componentFixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Placeholder');
  // Render loading state and verify rendered output.
  await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Loading);
  expect(componentFixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('Loading');
  // Render final state and verify the output.
  await deferBlockFixture.render(DeferBlockState.Complete);
  expect(componentFixture.nativeElement.innerHTML).toContain('large works!');
});
```

## Does `@defer` work with `NgModule`?

`@defer` blocks are compatible with both standalone and NgModule-based components, directives and pipes. However, **only standalone components, directives and pipes can be deferred**. NgModule-based dependencies are not deferred and are included in the eagerly loaded bundle.

## How does `@defer` work with server-side rendering (SSR) and static-site generation (SSG)?

By default, when rendering an application on the server (either using SSR or SSG), defer blocks always render their `@placeholder` (or nothing if a placeholder is not specified) and triggers are not invoked. On the client, the content of the `@placeholder` is hydrated and triggers are activated.

To render the main content of `@defer` blocks on the server (both SSR and SSG), you can enable [the Incremental Hydration feature](/guide/incremental-hydration) and configure `hydrate` triggers for the necessary blocks.

## Best practices for deferring views

### Avoid cascading loads with nested `@defer` blocks

When you have nested `@defer` blocks, they should have different triggers in order to avoid loading simultaneously, which causes cascading requests and may negatively impact page load performance.

### Avoid layout shifts

Avoid deferring components that are visible in the user’s viewport on initial load. Doing this may negatively affect Core Web Vitals by causing an increase in cumulative layout shift (CLS).

In the event this is necessary, avoid `immediate`, `timer`, `viewport`, and custom `when` triggers that cause the content to load during the initial page render.

FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/event-listeners.md
================================================
# Adding event listeners

Angular supports defining event listeners on an element in your template by specifying the event name inside parentheses along with a statement that runs every time the event occurs.

## Listening to native events

When you want to add event listeners to an HTML element, you wrap the event with parentheses, `()`, which allows you to specify a listener statement.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <input type="text" (keyup)="updateField()" />
  `,
  ...
})
export class AppComponent{
  updateField(): void {
    console.log('Field is updated!');
  }
}
```

In this example, Angular calls `updateField` every time the `<input>` element emits a `keyup` event.

You can add listeners for any native events, such as: `click`, `keydown`, `mouseover`, etc. To learn more, check out the [all available events on elements on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events).

## Accessing the event argument

In every template event listener, Angular provides a variable named `$event` that contains a reference to the event object.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <input type="text" (keyup)="updateField($event)" />
  `,
  ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  updateField(event: KeyboardEvent): void {
    console.log(`The user pressed: ${event.key}`);
  }
}
```

## Using key modifiers

When you want to capture specific keyboard events for a specific key, you might write some code like the following:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <input type="text" (keyup)="updateField($event)" />
  `,
  ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  updateField(event: KeyboardEvent): void {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      console.log('The user pressed enter in the text field.');
    }
  }
}
```

However, since this is a common scenario, Angular lets you filter the events by specifying a specific key using the period (`.`) character. By doing so, code can be simplified to:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <input type="text" (keyup.enter)="updateField($event)" />
  `,
  ...
})
export class AppComponent{
  updateField(event: KeyboardEvent): void {
    console.log('The user pressed enter in the text field.');
  }
}
```

You can also add additional key modifiers:

```angular-html
<!-- Matches shift and enter -->
<input type="text" (keyup.shift.enter)="updateField($event)" />
```

Angular supports the modifiers `alt`, `control`, `meta`, and `shift`.

You can specify the key or code that you would like to bind to keyboard events. The key and code fields are a native part of the browser keyboard event object. By default, event binding assumes you want to use the [Key values for keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_key_values).

Angular also allows you to specify [Code values for keyboard events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_code_values) by providing a built-in `code` suffix.

```angular-html
<!-- Matches alt and left shift -->
<input type="text" (keydown.code.alt.shiftleft)="updateField($event)" />
```

This can be useful for handling keyboard events consistently across different operating systems. For example, when using the Alt key on MacOS devices, the `key` property reports the key based on the character already modified by the Alt key. This means that a combination like Alt + S reports a `key` value of `'ß'`. The `code` property, however, corresponds to the physical or virtual button pressed rather than the character produced.

# Expression Syntax

Angular expressions are based on JavaScript, but differ in some key ways. This guide walks through the similarities and differences between Angular expressions and standard JavaScript.

## Value literals

Angular supports a subset of [literal values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Literal) from JavaScript.

### Supported value literals

| Literal type           | Example values                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| String                 | `'Hello'`, `"World"`            |
| Boolean                | `true`, `false`                 |
| Number                 | `123`, `3.14`                   |
| Object                 | `{name: 'Alice'}`               |
| Array                  | `['Onion', 'Cheese', 'Garlic']` |
| null                   | `null`                          |
| Template string        | `` `Hello ${name}` ``           |
| Tagged template string | `` tag`Hello ${name}` ``        |

### Unsupported literals

| Literal type           | Example value            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| RegExp                 | `/\d+/`                  |
| Tagged template string | `` tag`Hello ${name}` `` |

## Globals

Angular expressions support the following [globals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object):

- [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)
- [$any](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#any)

No other JavaScript globals are supported. Common JavaScript globals include `Number`, `Boolean`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `parseInt`, and more.

## Local variables

Angular automatically makes special local variables available for use in expressions in specific contexts. These special variables always start with the dollar sign character (`$`).

For example, `@for` blocks make several local variables corresponding to information about the loop, such as `$index`.

## What operators are supported?

### Supported operators

Angular supports the following operators from standard JavaScript.

| Operator              | Example(s)                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Add / Concatenate     | `1 + 2`                                  |
| Subtract              | `52 - 3`                                 |
| Multiply              | `41 * 6`                                 |
| Divide                | `20 / 4`                                 |
| Remainder (Modulo)    | `17 % 5`                                 |
| Exponentiation        | `10 ** 3`                                |
| Parenthesis           | `9 * (8 + 4)`                            |
| Conditional (Ternary) | `a > b ? true : false`                   |
| And (Logical)         | `&&`                                     |
| Or (Logical)          | `\|\|`                                   |
| Not (Logical)         | `!`                                      |
| Nullish Coalescing    | `possiblyNullValue ?? 'default'`         |
| Comparison Operators  | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!==` |
| Unary Negation        | `-x`                                     |
| Unary Plus            | `+y`                                     |
| Property Accessor     | `person['name']`                         |
| typeof                | `typeof 42`                              |
| void                  | `void 1`                                 |

Angular expressions additionally also support the following non-standard operators:

| Operator                        | Example(s)                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Pipe](/guide/templates/pipes) | `{{ total \| currency }}`      |
| Optional chaining\*             | `someObj.someProp?.nestedProp` |
| Non-null assertion (TypeScript) | `someObj!.someProp`            |

\*NOTE: Optional chaining behaves differently from the standard JavaScript version in that if the left side of Angular’s optional chaining operator is `null` or `undefined`, it returns `null` instead of `undefined`.

### Unsupported operators

| Operator              | Example(s)                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| All bitwise operators | `&`, `&=`, `~`, `\|=`, `^=`, etc. |
| Assignment operators  | `=`                               |
| Object destructuring  | `const { name } = person`         |
| Array destructuring   | `const [firstItem] = items`       |
| Comma operator        | `x = (x++, x)`                    |
| in                    | `'model' in car`                  |
| instanceof            | `car instanceof Automobile`       |
| new                   | `new Car()`                       |

## Lexical context for expressions

Angular expressions are evaluated within the context of the component class as well as any relevant [template variables](/guide/templates/variables), locals, and globals.

When referring to class members, `this` is always implied.

## Declarations

Generally speaking, declarations are not supported in Angular expressions. This includes, but is not limited to:

| Declarations    | Example(s)                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Variables       | `let label = 'abc'`, `const item = 'apple'` |
| Functions       | `function myCustomFunction() { }`           |
| Arrow Functions | `() => { }`                                 |
| Classes         | `class Rectangle { }`                       |

# Event listener statements

Event handlers are **statements** rather than expressions. While they support all of the same syntax as Angular expressions, the are two key differences:

1. Statements **do support** assignment operators (but not destructing assignments)
1. Statements **do not support** pipes



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/ng-container.md
================================================
# Grouping elements with ng-container

`<ng-container>` is a special element in Angular that groups multiple elements together or marks a location in a template without rendering a real element in the DOM.

```angular-html
<!-- Component template -->
<section>
  <ng-container>
    <h3>User bio</h3>
    <p>Here's some info about the user</p>
  </ng-container>
</section>
```

```angular-html
<!-- Rendered DOM -->
<section>
  <h3>User bio</h3>
  <p>Here's some info about the user</p>
</section>
```

You can apply directives to `<ng-container>` to add behaviors or configuration to a part of your template.

Angular ignores all attribute bindings and event listeners applied to `<ng-container>`, including those applied via directive.

## Using `<ng-container>` to display dynamic contents

`<ng-container>` can act as a placeholder for rendering dynamic content.

### Rendering components

You can use Angular's built-in `NgComponentOutlet` directive to dynamically render a component to the location of the `<ng-container>`.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <h2>Your profile</h2>
    <ng-container [ngComponentOutlet]="profileComponent()" />
  `
})
export class UserProfile {
  isAdmin = input(false);
  profileComponent = computed(() => this.isAdmin() ? AdminProfile : BasicUserProfile);
}
```

In the example above, the `NgComponentOutlet` directive dynamically renders either `AdminProfile` or `BasicUserProfile` in the location of the `<ng-container>` element.

### Rendering template fragments

You can use Angular's built-in `NgTemplateOutlet` directive to dynamically render a template fragment to the location of the `<ng-container>`.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <h2>Your profile</h2>
    <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]="profileTemplate()" />

    <ng-template #admin>This is the admin profile</ng-template>
    <ng-template #basic>This is the basic profile</ng-template>
  `
})
export class UserProfile {
  isAdmin = input(false);
  adminTemplate = viewChild('admin', {read: TemplateRef});
  basicTemplate = viewChild('basic', {read: TemplateRef});
  profileTemplate = computed(() => this.isAdmin() ? this.adminTemplate() : this.basicTemplate());
}
```

In the example above, the `ngTemplateOutlet` directive dynamically renders one of two template fragments in the location of the `<ng-container>` element.

For more information regarding NgTemplateOutlet, see the [NgTemplateOutlets API documentation page](/api/common/NgTemplateOutlet).

## Using `<ng-container>` with structural directives

You can also apply structural directives to `<ng-container>` elements. Common examples of this include `ngIf`and `ngFor`.

```angular-html
<ng-container *ngIf="permissions == 'admin'">
  <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
  <admin-infographic></admin-infographic>
</ng-container>

<ng-container *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">
  <h2>{{ item.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ item.description }}</p>
</ng-container>
```

## Using `<ng-container>` for injection

See the Dependency Injection guide for more information on Angular's dependency injection system.

When you apply a directive to `<ng-container>`, descendant elements can inject the directive or anything that the directive provides. Use this when you want to declaratively provide a value to a specific part of your template.

```angular-ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[theme]',
})
export class Theme {
  // Create an input that accepts 'light' or 'dark`, defaulting to 'light'.
  mode = input<'light' | 'dark'>('light');
}
```

```angular-html
<ng-container theme="dark">
  <profile-pic />
  <user-bio />
</ng-container>
```

In the example above, the `ProfilePic` and `UserBio` components can inject the `Theme` directive and apply styles based on its `mode`.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/ng-content.md
================================================
# Render templates from a parent component with `ng-content`

`<ng-content>` is a special element that accepts markup or a template fragment and controls how components render content. It does not render a real DOM element.

Here is an example of a `BaseButton` component that accepts any markup from its parent.

```angular-ts
// ./base-button/base-button.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'button[baseButton]',
  template: `
      <ng-content />
  `,
})
export class BaseButton {}
```

```angular-ts
// ./app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { BaseButton } from './base-button/base-button.component.ts';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [BaseButton],
  template: `
    <button baseButton>
      Next <span class="icon arrow-right" />
    </button>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

For more detail, check out the [`<ng-content>` in-depth guide](/guide/components/content-projection) for other ways you can leverage this pattern.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/ng-template.md
================================================
# Create template fragments with ng-template

Inspired by the [native `<template>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template), the `<ng-template>` element lets you declare a **template fragment** – a section of content that you can dynamically or programmatically render.

## Creating a template fragment

You can create a template fragment inside of any component template with the `<ng-template>` element:

```angular-html
<p>This is a normal element</p>

<ng-template>
  <p>This is a template fragment</p>
</ng-template>
```

When the above is rendered, the content of the `<ng-template>` element is not rendered on the page. Instead, you can get a reference to the template fragment and write code to dynamically render it.

### Binding context for fragments

Template fragments may contain bindings with dynamic expressions:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  template: `<ng-template>You've selected {{count}} items.</ng-template>`,
})
export class ItemCounter {
  count: number = 0;
}
```

Expressions or statements in a template fragment are evaluated against the component in which the fragment is declared, regardless of where the fragment is rendered.

## Getting a reference to a template fragment

You can get a reference to a template fragment in one of three ways:

- By declaring a [template reference variable](/guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables) on the `<ng-template>` element
- By querying for the fragment with [a component or directive query](/guide/components/queries)
- By injecting the fragment in a directive that's applied directly to an `<ng-template>` element.

In all three cases, the fragment is represented by a [TemplateRef](/api/core/TemplateRef) object.

### Referencing a template fragment with a template reference variable

You can add a template reference variable to an `<ng-template>` element to reference that template fragment in other parts of the same template file:

```angular-html
<p>This is a normal element</p>

<ng-template #myFragment>
  <p>This is a template fragment</p>
</ng-template>
```

You can then reference this fragment anywhere else in the template via the `myFragment` variable.

### Referencing a template fragment with queries

You can get a reference to a template fragment using any [component or directive query API](/guide/components/queries).

For example, if your template has exactly one template fragment, you can query directly for the `TemplateRef` object with a `@ViewChild` query:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  template: `
    <p>This is a normal element</p>

    <ng-template>
      <p>This is a template fragment</p>
    </ng-template>
  `,
})
export class ComponentWithFragment {
  @ViewChild(TemplateRef) myFragment: TemplateRef<unknown> | undefined;
}
```

You can then reference this fragment in your component code or the component's template like any other class member.

If a template contains multiple fragments, you can assign a name to each fragment by adding a template reference variable to each `<ng-template>` element and querying for the fragments based on that name:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  template: `
    <p>This is a normal element</p>

    <ng-template #fragmentOne>
      <p>This is one template fragment</p>
    </ng-template>

    <ng-template #fragmentTwo>
      <p>This is another template fragment</p>
    </ng-template>
  `,
})
export class ComponentWithFragment {
  // When querying by name, you can use the `read` option to specify that you want to get the
  // TemplateRef object associated with the element.
  @ViewChild('fragmentOne', {read: TemplateRef}) fragmentOne: TemplateRef<unknown> | undefined;
  @ViewChild('fragmentTwo', {read: TemplateRef}) fragmentTwo: TemplateRef<unknown> | undefined;
}
```

Again, you can then reference these fragments in your component code or the component's template like any other class members.

### Injecting a template fragment

A directive can inject a `TemplateRef` if that directive is applied directly to an `<ng-template>` element:

```angular-ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[myDirective]'
})
export class MyDirective {
  private fragment = inject(TemplateRef);
}
```

```angular-html
<ng-template myDirective>
  <p>This is one template fragment</p>
</ng-template>
```

You can then reference this fragment in your directive code like any other class member.

## Rendering a template fragment

Once you have a reference to a template fragment's `TemplateRef` object, you can render a fragment in one of two ways: in your template with the `NgTemplateOutlet` directive or in your TypeScript code with `ViewContainerRef`.

### Using `NgTemplateOutlet`

The `NgTemplateOutlet` directive from `@angular/common` accepts a `TemplateRef` and renders the fragment as a **sibling** to the element with the outlet. You should generally use `NgTemplateOutlet` on an [`<ng-container>` element](/guide/templates/ng-container).

First, import `NgTemplateOutlet`:
```typescript
import { NgTemplateOutlet } from '@angular/common';
```

The following example declares a template fragment and renders that fragment to a `<ng-container>` element with `NgTemplateOutlet`:

```angular-html
<p>This is a normal element</p>

<ng-template #myFragment>
  <p>This is a fragment</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="myFragment"></ng-container>
```

This example produces the following rendered DOM:

```angular-html
<p>This is a normal element</p>
<p>This is a fragment</p>
```

### Using `ViewContainerRef`

A **view container** is a node in Angular's component tree that can contain content. Any component or directive can inject `ViewContainerRef` to get a reference to a view container corresponding to that component or directive's location in the DOM.

You can use the `createEmbeddedView` method on `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically render a template fragment. When you render a fragment with a `ViewContainerRef`, Angular appends it into the DOM as the next sibling of the component or directive that injected the `ViewContainerRef`.

The following example shows a component that accepts a reference to a template fragment as an input and renders that fragment into the DOM on a button click.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  selector: 'component-with-fragment',
  template: `
    <h2>Component with a fragment</h2>
    <ng-template #myFragment>
      <p>This is the fragment</p>
    </ng-template>
    <my-outlet [fragment]="myFragment" />
  `,
})
export class ComponentWithFragment { }

@Component({
  /* ... */,
  selector: 'my-outlet',
  template: `<button (click)="showFragment()">Show</button>`,
})
export class MyOutlet {
  private viewContainer = inject(ViewContainerRef);
  @Input() fragment: TemplateRef<unknown> | undefined;

  showFragment() {
    if (this.fragment) {
      this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.fragment);
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, clicking the "Show" button results in the following output:

```angular-html
<component-with-fragment>
  <h2>Component with a fragment>
  <my-outlet>
    <button>Show</button>
  </my-outlet>
  <p>This is the fragment</p>
</component-with-fragment>
```

## Passing parameters when rendering a template fragment

When declaring a template fragment with `<ng-template>`, you can additionally declare parameters accepted by the fragment. When you render a fragment, you can optimally pass a `context` object corresponding to these parameters. You can use data from this context object in binding expressions and statements, in addition to referencing data from the component in which the fragment is declared.

Each parameter is written as an attribute prefixed with `let-` with a value matching a property name in the context object:

```angular-html
<ng-template let-pizzaTopping="topping">
  <p>You selected: {{pizzaTopping}}</p>
</ng-template>
```

### Using `NgTemplateOutlet`

You can bind a context object to the `ngTemplateOutletContext` input:

```angular-html
<ng-template #myFragment let-pizzaTopping="topping">
  <p>You selected: {{pizzaTopping}}</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-container
  [ngTemplateOutlet]="myFragment"
  [ngTemplateOutletContext]="{topping: 'onion'}"
/>
```

### Using `ViewContainerRef`

You can pass a context object as the second argument to `createEmbeddedView`:

```angular-ts
this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.myFragment, {topping: 'onion'});
```

## Structural directives

A **structural directive** is any directive that:

- Injects `TemplateRef`
- Injects `ViewContainerRef` and programmatically renders the injected `TemplateRef`

Angular supports a special convenience syntax for structural directives. If you apply the directive to an element and prefix the directive's selector with an asterisk (`*`) character, Angular interprets the entire element and all of its content as a template fragment:

```angular-html
<section *myDirective>
  <p>This is a fragment</p>
</section>
```

This is equivalent to:

```angular-html
<ng-template myDirective>
  <section>
    <p>This is a fragment</p>
  </section>
</ng-template>
```

Developers typically use structural directives to conditionally render fragments or render fragments multiple times.

For more details, see [Structural Directives](/guide/directives/structural-directives).

## Additional resources

For examples of how `ng-template` is used in other libraries, check out:

- [Tabs from Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/tabs/overview) - nothing gets rendered into the DOM until the tab is activated
- [Table from Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview) - allows developers to define different ways to render data

<docs-decorative-header title="Template syntax" imgSrc="adev/src/assets/images/templates.svg"> <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->
In Angular, a template is a chunk of HTML.
Use special syntax within a template to leverage many of Angular's features.
</docs-decorative-header>

TIP: Check out Angular's [Essentials](essentials/templates) before diving into this comprehensive guide.

Every Angular component has a **template** that defines the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) that the component renders onto the page. By using templates, Angular is able to automatically keep your page up-to-date as data changes.

Templates are usually found within either the `template` property of a `*.component.ts` file or the `*.component.html` file. To learn more, check out the [in-depth components guide](/guide/components).

## How do templates work?

Templates are based on [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) syntax, with additional features such as built-in template functions, data binding, event listening, variables, and more.

Angular compiles templates into JavaScript in order to build up an internal understanding of your application. One of the benefits of this are built-in rendering optimizations that Angular applies to your application automatically.

### Differences from standard HTML

Some differences between templates and standard HTML syntax include:

- Comments in the template source code are not included in the rendered output
- Component and directive elements can be self-closed (e.g., `<UserProfile />`)
- Attributes with certain characters (i.e., `[]`, `()`, etc.) have special meaning to Angular. See [binding docs](guide/templates/binding) and [adding event listeners docs](guide/templates/event-listeners) for more information.
- The `@` character has a special meaning to Angular for adding dynamic behavior, such as [control flow](guide/templates/control-flow), to templates. You can include a literal `@` character by escaping it as an HTML entity code (`&commat;` or `&#64;`).
- Angular ignores and collapses unnecessary whitespace characters. See [whitespace in templates](guide/templates/whitespace) for more details.
- Angular may add comment nodes to a page as placeholders for dynamic content, but developers can ignore these.

In addition, while most HTML syntax is valid template syntax, Angular does not support `<script>` element in templates. For more information, see the [Security](best-practices/security) page.

# Pipes

## Overview

Pipes are a special operator in Angular template expressions that allows you to transform data declaratively in your template. Pipes let you declare a transformation function once and then use that transformation across multiple templates. Angular pipes use the vertical bar character (`|`), inspired by the [Unix pipe](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>).

NOTE: Angular's pipe syntax deviates from standard JavaScript, which uses the vertical bar character for the [bitwise OR operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_OR). Angular template expressions do not support bitwise operators.

Here is an example using some built-in pipes that Angular provides:

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CurrencyPipe, DatePipe, TitleCasePipe } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [CurrencyPipe, DatePipe, TitleCasePipe],
  template: `
    <main>
       <!-- Transform the company name to title-case and
       transform the purchasedOn date to a locale-formatted string -->
<h1>Purchases from {{ company | titlecase }} on {{ purchasedOn | date }}</h1>

	    <!-- Transform the amount to a currency-formatted string -->
      <p>Total: {{ amount | currency }}</p>
    </main>
  `,
})
export class ShoppingCartComponent {
  amount = 123.45;
  company = 'acme corporation';
  purchasedOn = '2024-07-08';
}
```

When Angular renders the component, it will ensure that the appropriate date format and currency is based on the locale of the user. If the user is in the United States, it would render:

```angular-html
<main>
  <h1>Purchases from Acme Corporation on Jul 8, 2024</h1>
  <p>Total: $123.45</p>
</main>
```

See the [in-depth guide on i18n](/guide/i18n) to learn more about how Angular localizes values.

### Built-in Pipes

Angular includes a set of built-in pipes in the `@angular/common` package:

| Name                                          | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`AsyncPipe`](api/common/AsyncPipe)           | Read the value from a `Promise` or an RxJS `Observable`.                                      |
| [`CurrencyPipe`](api/common/CurrencyPipe)     | Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.                |
| [`DatePipe`](api/common/DatePipe)             | Formats a `Date` value according to locale rules.                                             |
| [`DecimalPipe`](api/common/DecimalPipe)       | Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.  |
| [`I18nPluralPipe`](api/common/I18nPluralPipe) | Maps a value to a string that pluralizes the value according to locale rules.                 |
| [`I18nSelectPipe`](api/common/I18nSelectPipe) | Maps a key to a custom selector that returns a desired value.                                 |
| [`JsonPipe`](api/common/JsonPipe)             | Transforms an object to a string representation via `JSON.stringify`, intended for debugging. |
| [`KeyValuePipe`](api/common/KeyValuePipe)     | Transforms Object or Map into an array of key value pairs.                                    |
| [`LowerCasePipe`](api/common/LowerCasePipe)   | Transforms text to all lower case.                                                            |
| [`PercentPipe`](api/common/PercentPipe)       | Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.              |
| [`SlicePipe`](api/common/SlicePipe)           | Creates a new Array or String containing a subset (slice) of the elements.                    |
| [`TitleCasePipe`](api/common/TitleCasePipe)   | Transforms text to title case.                                                                |
| [`UpperCasePipe`](api/common/UpperCasePipe)   | Transforms text to all upper case.                                                            |

## Using pipes

Angular's pipe operator uses the vertical bar character (`|`), within a template expression. The pipe operator is a binary operator– the left-hand operand is the value passed to the transformation function, and the right side operand is the name of the pipe and any additional arguments (described below).

```angular-html
<p>Total: {{ amount | currency }}</p>
```

In this example, the value of `amount` is passed into the `CurrencyPipe` where the pipe name is `currency`. It then renders the default currency for the user’s locale.

### Combining multiple pipes in the same expression

You can apply multiple transformations to a value by using multiple pipe operators. Angular runs the pipes from left to right.

The following example demonstrates a combination of pipes to display a localized date in all uppercase:

```angular-html
<p>The event will occur on {{ scheduledOn | date | uppercase }}.</p>
```

### Passing parameters to pipes

Some pipes accept parameters to configure the transformation. To specify a parameter, append the pipe name with a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter value.

For example, the `DatePipe` is able to take parameters to format the date in a specific way.

```angular-html
<p>The event will occur at {{ scheduledOn | date:'hh:mm' }}.</p>
```

Some pipes may accept multiple parameters. You can specify additional parameter values separated by the colon character (`:`).

For example, we can also pass a second optional parameter to control the timezone.

```angular-html
<p>The event will occur at {{ scheduledOn | date:'hh:mm':'UTC' }}.</p>
```

## How pipes work

Conceptually, pipes are functions that accept an input value and return a transformed value.

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CurrencyPipe} from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [CurrencyPipe],
  template: `
    <main>
      <p>Total: {{ amount | currency }}</p>
    </main>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  amount = 123.45;
}
```

In this example:

1. `CurrencyPipe` is imported from `@angular/common`
1. `CurrencyPipe` is added to the `imports` array
1. The `amount` data is passed to the `currency` pipe

### Pipe operator precedence

The pipe operator has lower precedence than other binary operators, including `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, and `??`.

```angular-html
<!-- firstName and lastName are concatenated before the result is passed to the uppercase pipe -->
{{ firstName + lastName | uppercase }}
```

The pipe operator has higher precedence than the conditional (ternary) operator.

```angular-html
{{ (isAdmin ? 'Access granted' : 'Access denied') | uppercase }}
```

If the same expression were written without parentheses:

```angular-html
{{ isAdmin ? 'Access granted' : 'Access denied' | uppercase }}
```

It will be parsed instead as:

```angular-html
{{ isAdmin ? 'Access granted' : ('Access denied' | uppercase) }}
```

Always use parentheses in your expressions when operator precedence may be ambiguous.

### Change detection with pipes

By default, all pipes are considered `pure`, which means that it only executes when a primitive input value (such as a `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, or `Symbol`) or a changed object reference (such as `Array`, `Object`, `Function`, or `Date`). Pure pipes offer a performance advantage because Angular can avoid calling the transformation function if the passed value has not changed.

As a result, this means that mutations to object properties or array items are not detected unless the entire object or array reference is replaced with a different instance. If you want this level of change detection, refer to [detecting changes within arrays or objects](#detecting-change-within-arrays-or-objects).

## Creating custom pipes

You can define a custom pipe by implementing a TypeScript class with the `@Pipe` decorator. A pipe must have two things:

- A name, specified in the pipe decorator
- A method named `transform` that performs the value transformation.

The TypeScript class should additionally implement the `PipeTransform` interface to ensure that it satisfies the type signature for a pipe.

Here is an example of a custom pipe that transforms strings to kebab case:

```angular-ts
// kebab-case.pipe.ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'kebabCase',
})
export class KebabCasePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-');
  }
}
```

### Using the `@Pipe` decorator

When creating a custom pipe, import `Pipe` from the `@angular/core` package and use it as a decorator for the TypeScript class.

```angular-ts
import { Pipe } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'myCustomTransformation',
})
export class MyCustomTransformationPipe {}
```

The `@Pipe` decorator requires a `name` that controls how the pipe is used in a template.

### Naming convention for custom pipes

The naming convention for custom pipes consists of two conventions:

- `name` - camelCase is recommended. Do not use hyphens.
- `class name` - PascalCase version of the `name` with `Pipe` appended to the end

### Implement the `PipeTransform` interface

In addition to the `@Pipe` decorator, custom pipes should always implement the `PipeTransform` interface from `@angular/core`.

```angular-ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'myCustomTransformation',
})
export class MyCustomTransformationPipe implements PipeTransform {}
```

Implementing this interface ensures that your pipe class has the correct structure.

### Transforming the value of a pipe

Every transformation is invoked by the `transform` method with the first parameter being the value being passed in and the return value being the transformed value.

```angular-ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'myCustomTransformation',
})
export class MyCustomTransformationPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return `My custom transformation of ${value}.`
  }
}
```

### Adding parameters to a custom pipe

You can add parameters to your transformation by adding additional parameters to the `transform` method:

```angular-ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'myCustomTransformation',
})
export class MyCustomTransformationPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string, format: string): string {
    let msg = `My custom transformation of ${value}.`

    if (format === 'uppercase') {
      return msg.toUpperCase()
    } else {
      return msg
    }
  }
}
```

### Detecting change within arrays or objects

When you want a pipe to detect changes within arrays or objects, it must be marked as an impure function by passing the `pure` flag with a value of `false`.

Avoid creating impure pipes unless absolutely necessary, as they can incur a significant performance penalty if used without care.

```angular-ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'joinNamesImpure',
  pure: false,
})
export class JoinNamesImpurePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(names: string[]): string {
    return names.join();
  }
}
```

Angular developers often adopt the convention of including `Impure` in the pipe `name` and class name to indicate the potential performance pitfall to other developers.

================================================
# Two-way binding

**Two way binding** is a shorthand to simultaneously bind a value into an element, while also giving that element the ability to propagate changes back through this binding.

## Syntax

The syntax for two-way binding is a combination of square brackets and parentheses, `[()]`. It combines the syntax from property binding, `[]`, and the syntax from event binding, `()`. The Angular community informally refers to this syntax as "banana-in-a-box".

## Two-way binding with form controls

Developers commonly use two-way binding to keep component data in sync with a form control as a user interacts with the control. For example, when a user fills out a text input, it should update the state in the component.

The following example dynamically updates the `firstName` attribute on the page:

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  imports: [FormsModule],
  template: `
    <main>
      <h2>Hello {{ firstName }}!</h2>
      <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="firstName" />
    </main>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstName = 'Ada';
}
```

To use two-way binding with native form controls, you need to:

1. Import the `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms`
1. Use the `ngModel` directive with the two-way binding syntax (e.g., `[(ngModel)]`)
1. Assign it the state that you want it to update (e.g., `firstName`)

Once that is set up, Angular will ensure that any updates in the text input will reflect correctly inside of the component state!

Learn more about [`NgModel`](guide/directives#displaying-and-updating-properties-with-ngmodel) in the official docs.

## Two-way binding between components

Leveraging two-way binding between a parent and child component requires more configuration compared to form elements.

Here is an example where the `AppComponent` is responsible for setting the initial count state, but the logic for updating and rendering the UI for the counter primarily resides inside its child `CounterComponent`.

```angular-ts
// ./app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CounterComponent } from './counter/counter.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [CounterComponent],
  template: `
    <main>
      <h1>Counter: {{ initialCount }}</h1>
      <app-counter [(count)]="initialCount"></app-counter>
    </main>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  initialCount = 18;
}
```

```angular-ts
// './counter/counter.component.ts';
import { Component, model } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `
    <button (click)="updateCount(-1)">-</button>
    <span>{{ count() }}</span>
    <button (click)="updateCount(+1)">+</button>
  `,
})
export class CounterComponent {
  count = model<number>(0);

  updateCount(amount: number): void {
    this.count.update(currentCount => currentCount + amount);
  }
}
```

### Enabling two-way binding between components

If we break down the example above to its core, each two-way binding for components requires the following:

The child component must contain a `model` property.

Here is a simplified example:

```angular-ts
// './counter/counter.component.ts';
import { Component, model } from '@angular/core';

@Component({ // Omitted for brevity })
export class CounterComponent {
  count = model<number>(0);

  updateCount(amount: number): void {
    this.count.update(currentCount => currentCount + amount);
  }
}
```

The parent component must:

1. Wrap the `model` property name in the two-way binding syntax.
1. Assign a property or a signal to the `model` property.

Here is a simplified example:

```angular-ts
// ./app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CounterComponent } from './counter/counter.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [CounterComponent],
  template: `
    <main>
      <app-counter [(count)]="initialCount"></app-counter>
    </main>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  initialCount = 18;
}
```



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/variables.md
================================================
# Variables in templates

Angular has two types of variable declarations in templates: local template variables and template reference variables.

## Local template variables with `@let`

Angular's `@let` syntax allows you to define a local variable and re-use it across a template, similar to the [JavaScript `let` syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let).

### Using `@let`

Use `@let` to declare a variable whose value is based on the result of a template expression. Angular automatically keeps the variable's value up-to-date with the given expression, similar to [bindings](./templates/bindings).

```angular-html
@let name = user.name;
@let greeting = 'Hello, ' + name;
@let data = data$ | async;
@let pi = 3.1459;
@let coordinates = {x: 50, y: 100};
@let longExpression = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit ' +
                      'sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna ' +
                      'Ut enim ad minim veniam...';
```

Each `@let` block can declare exactly one variable. You cannot declare multiple variables in the same block with a comma.

### Referencing the value of `@let`

Once you've declared a variable with `@let`, you can reuse it in the same template:

```angular-html
@let user = user$ | async;

@if (user) {
  <h1>Hello, {{user.name}}</h1>
  <user-avatar [photo]="user.photo"/>

  <ul>
    @for (snack of user.favoriteSnacks; track snack.id) {
      <li>{{snack.name}}</li>
    }
  </ul>

  <button (click)="update(user)">Update profile</button>
}
```

### Assignability

A key difference between `@let` and JavaScript's `let` is that `@let` cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, Angular automatically keeps the variable's value up-to-date with the given expression.

```angular-html
@let value = 1;

<!-- Invalid - This does not work! -->
<button (click)="value = value + 1">Increment the value</button>
```

### Variable scope

`@let` declarations are scoped to the current view and its descendants. Angular creates a new view at component boundaries and wherever a template might contain dynamic content, such as control flow blocks, `@defer` blocks, or structural directives.

Since `@let` declarations are not hoisted, they **cannot** be accessed by parent views or siblings:

```angular-html
@let topLevel = value;

<div>
  @let insideDiv = value;
</div>

{{topLevel}} <!-- Valid -->
{{insideDiv}} <!-- Valid -->

@if (condition) {
  {{topLevel + insideDiv}} <!-- Valid -->

  @let nested = value;

  @if (condition) {
    {{topLevel + insideDiv + nested}} <!-- Valid -->
  }
}

<div *ngIf="condition">
  {{topLevel + insideDiv}} <!-- Valid -->

  @let nestedNgIf = value;

  <div *ngIf="condition">
     {{topLevel + insideDiv + nestedNgIf}} <!-- Valid -->
  </div>
</div>

{{nested}} <!-- Error, not hoisted from @if -->
{{nestedNgIf}} <!-- Error, not hoisted from *ngIf -->
```

### Full syntax

The `@let` syntax is formally defined as:

- The `@let` keyword.
- Followed by one or more whitespaces, not including new lines.
- Followed by a valid JavaScript name and zero or more whitespaces.
- Followed by the = symbol and zero or more whitespaces.
- Followed by an Angular expression which can be multi-line.
- Terminated by the `;` symbol.

## Template reference variables

Template reference variables give you a way to declare a variable that references a value from an element in your template.

A template reference variable can refer to the following:

- a DOM element within a template (including [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements))
- an Angular component or directive
- a [TemplateRef](/api/core/TemplateRef) from an [ng-template](/api/core/ng-template)

You can use template reference variables to read information from one part of the template in another part of the same template.

### Declaring a template reference variable

You can declare a variable on an element in a template by adding an attribute that starts with the hash character (`#`) followed by the variable name.

```angular-html
<!-- Create a template reference variable named "taskInput", referring to the HTMLInputElement. -->
<input #taskInput placeholder="Enter task name">
```

### Assigning values to template reference variables

Angular assigns a value to template variables based on the element on which the variable is declared.

If you declare the variable on a Angular component, the variable refers to the component instance.

```angular-html
<!-- The `startDate` variable is assigned the instance of `MyDatepicker`. -->
<my-datepicker #startDate />
```

If you declare the variable on an `<ng-template>` element, the variable refers to a TemplateRef instance which represents the template. For more information, see [How Angular uses the asterisk, \*, syntax](/guide/directives/structural-directives#asterisk) in [Structural directives](/guide/directives/structural-directives).

```angular-html
<!-- The `myFragment` variable is assigned the `TemplateRef` instance corresponding to this template fragment. -->
<ng-template #myFragment>
  <p>This is a template fragment</p>
</ng-template>
```

If you declare the variable on any other displayed element, the variable refers to the `HTMLElement` instance.

```angular-html
<!-- The "taskInput" variable refers to the HTMLInputElement instance. -->
<input #taskInput placeholder="Enter task name">
```

#### Assigning a reference to an Angular directive

Angular directives may have an `exportAs` property that defines a name by which the directive can be referenced in a template:

```angular-ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[dropZone]',
  exportAs: 'dropZone',
})
export class DropZone { /* ... */ }
```

When you declare a template variable on an element, you can assign that variable a directive instance by specifying this `exportAs` name:

```angular-html
<!-- The `firstZone` variable refers to the `DropZone` directive instance. -->
<section dropZone #firstZone="dropZone"> ... </section>
```

You cannot refer to a directive that does not specify an `exportAs` name.

### Using template reference variables with queries

In addition to using template variables to read values from another part of the same template, you can also use this style of variable declaration to "mark" an element for [component and directive queries](/guide/components/queries).

When you want to query for a specific element in a template, you can declare a template variable on that element and then query for the element based on the variable name.

```angular-html
 <input #description value="Original description">
```

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  template: `<input #description value="Original description">`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  // Query for the input element based on the template variable name.
  @ViewChild('description') input: ElementRef | undefined;
}
```

See [Referencing children with queries](/guide/components/queries) for more information on queries.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/templates/whitespace.md
================================================
# Whitespace in templates

By default, Angular templates do not preserve whitespace that the framework considers unnecessary. This commonly occurs in two situations: whitespace between elements, and collapsible whitespace inside of text.

## Whitespace between elements

Most developers prefer to format their templates with newlines and indentation to make the template readable:

```angular-html
<section>
  <h3>User profile</p>
  <label>
    User name
    <input>
  </label>
</section>
```

This template contains whitespace between all of the elements. The following snippet shows the same HTML with each whitespace character replaced with the hash (`#`) character to highlight how much whitespace is present:

```angular-html
<!-- Total Whitespace: 20 -->
<section>###<h3>User profile</p>###<label>#####User name#####<input>###</label>#</section>
```

Preserving the whitespace as written in the template would result in many unnecessary [text nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Text) and increase page rendering overhead. By ignoring this whitespace between elements, Angular performs less work when rendering the template on the page, improving overall performance.

## Collapsible whitespace inside text

When your web browser renders HTML on a page, it collapses multiple consecutive whitespace characters to a single character:

```angular-html
<!-- What it looks like in the template -->
<p>Hello         world</p>
```

In this example, the browser displays only a single space between "Hello" and "world".

```angular-html
<!-- What shows up in the browser -->
<p>Hello world</p>
```

See [How whitespace is handled by HTML, CSS, and in the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Whitespace) for more context on how this works.

Angular avoids sending these unnecessary whitespace characters to the browser in the first place by collapsing them to a single character when it compiles the template.

## Preserving whitespace

You can tell Angular to preserve whitespace in a template by specifying `preserveWhitespaces: true` in the `@Component` decorator for a template.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  /* ... */,
  preserveWhitespaces: true,
  template: `
    <p>Hello         world</p>
  `
})
```

Avoid setting this option unless absolutely necessary. Preserving whitespace can cause Angular to produce significantly more nodes while rendering, slowing down your application.

You can additionally use a special HTML entity unique to Angular, `&ngsp;`. This entity produces a single space character that's preserved in the compiled output.

# Testing Attribute Directives

An *attribute directive* modifies the behavior of an element, component or another directive.
Its name reflects the way the directive is applied: as an attribute on a host element.

## Testing the `HighlightDirective`

The sample application's `HighlightDirective` sets the background color of an element based on either a data bound color or a default color \(lightgray\).
It also sets a custom property of the element \(`customProperty`\) to `true` for no reason other than to show that it can.

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.ts"/>

It's used throughout the application, perhaps most simply in the `AboutComponent`:

<docs-code header="app/about/about.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/about/about.component.ts"/>

Testing the specific use of the `HighlightDirective` within the `AboutComponent` requires only the techniques explored in the ["Nested component tests"](guide/testing/components-scenarios#nested-component-tests) section of [Component testing scenarios](guide/testing/components-scenarios).

<docs-code header="app/about/about.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/about/about.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

However, testing a single use case is unlikely to explore the full range of a directive's capabilities.
Finding and testing all components that use the directive is tedious, brittle, and almost as unlikely to afford full coverage.

*Class-only tests* might be helpful, but attribute directives like this one tend to manipulate the DOM.
Isolated unit tests don't touch the DOM and, therefore, do not inspire confidence in the directive's efficacy.

A better solution is to create an artificial test component that demonstrates all ways to apply the directive.

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts (TestComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-component"/>

<img alt="HighlightDirective spec in action" src="assets/images/guide/testing/highlight-directive-spec.png">

HELPFUL: The `<input>` case binds the `HighlightDirective` to the name of a color value in the input box.
The initial value is the word "cyan" which should be the background color of the input box.

Here are some tests of this component:

<docs-code header="app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/highlight.directive.spec.ts" visibleRegion="selected-tests"/>

A few techniques are noteworthy:

* The `By.directive` predicate is a great way to get the elements that have this directive *when their element types are unknown*
* The [`:not` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:not) in `By.css('h2:not([highlight])')` helps find `<h2>` elements that *do not* have the directive.
    `By.css('*:not([highlight])')` finds *any* element that does not have the directive.

* `DebugElement.styles` affords access to element styles even in the absence of a real browser, thanks to the `DebugElement` abstraction.
    But feel free to exploit the `nativeElement` when that seems easier or more clear than the abstraction.

* Angular adds a directive to the injector of the element to which it is applied.
    The test for the default color uses the injector of the second `<h2>` to get its `HighlightDirective` instance and its `defaultColor`.

* `DebugElement.properties` affords access to the artificial custom property that is set by the directive

# Find out how much code you're testing

The Angular CLI can run unit tests and create code coverage reports.
Code coverage reports show you any parts of your code base that might not be properly tested by your unit tests.

To generate a coverage report run the following command in the root of your project.

<docs-code language="shell">
ng test --no-watch --code-coverage
</docs-code>

When the tests are complete, the command creates a new `/coverage` directory in the project.
Open the `index.html` file to see a report with your source code and code coverage values.

If you want to create code-coverage reports every time you test, set the following option in the Angular CLI configuration file, `angular.json`:

<docs-code language="json">
"test": {
  "options": {
    "codeCoverage": true
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Code coverage enforcement

The code coverage percentages let you estimate how much of your code is tested.
If your team decides on a set minimum amount to be unit tested, enforce this minimum with the Angular CLI.

For example, suppose you want the code base to have a minimum of 80% code coverage.
To enable this, open the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test platform configuration file, `karma.conf.js`, and add the `check` property in the `coverageReporter:` key.

<docs-code language="javascript">
coverageReporter: {
  dir: require('path').join(__dirname, './coverage/<project-name>'),
  subdir: '.',
  reporters: [
    { type: 'html' },
    { type: 'text-summary' }
  ],
  check: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    }
  }
}
</docs-code>

HELPFUL: Read more about creating and fine tuning Karma configuration in the [testing guide](guide/testing#configuration).

The `check` property causes the tool to enforce a minimum of 80% code coverage when the unit tests are run in the project.

Read more on coverage configuration options in the [karma coverage documentation](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/blob/master/docs/configuration.md).

================================================
# Component harnesses overview

A <strong>component harness</strong> is a class that allows tests to interact with components the way an end user does via a supported API. You can create test harnesses for any component, ranging from small reusable widgets to full pages.

Harnesses offer several benefits:
- They make tests less brittle by insulating themselves against implementation details of a component, such as its DOM structure
- They make tests become more readable and easier to maintain
- They can be used across multiple testing environments

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of test with a harness for a component called MyButtonComponent
it('should load button with exact text', async () => {
  const button = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonComponentHarness);
  expect(await button.getText()).toBe('Confirm');
});
</docs-code>

Component harnesses are especially useful for shared UI widgets. Developers often write tests that depend on private implementation details of widgets, such as DOM structure and CSS classes. Those dependencies make tests brittle and hard to maintain. Harnesses offer an alternative— a supported API that interacts with the widget the same way an end-user does. Widget implementation changes now become less likely to break user tests. For example, [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) provides a test harness for each component in the library.

Component harnesses support multiple testing environments. You can use the same harness implementation in both unit and end-to-end tests. Test authors only need to learn one API and component authors don't have to maintain separate unit and end-to-end test implementations.

Many developers can be categorized by one of the following developer type categories: test authors, component harness authors, and harness environment authors. Use the table below to find the most relevant section in this guide based on these categories:

| Developer Type              | Description           | Relevant Section      |
|:---                         | :---                  | :---                  |
| Test Authors                | Developers that use component harnesses written by someone else to test their application. For example, this could be an app developer who uses a third-party menu component and needs to interact with the menu in a unit test. | [Using component harnesses in tests](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses) |
| Component harness authors   | Developers who maintain some reusable Angular components and want to create a test harness for its users to use in their tests. For example, an author of a third party Angular component library or a developer who maintains a set of common components for a large Angular application. | [Creating component harnesses for your components](guide/testing/creating-component-harnesses ) |
| Harness environment authors | Developers who want to add support for using component harnesses in additional testing environments. For information on supported testing environments out-of-the-box, see the [test harness environments and loaders](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses#test-harness-environments-and-loaders). | [Adding support for additional testing environments](guide/testing/component-harnesses-testing-environments) |

For the full API reference, please see the [Angular CDK's component harness API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api).

# Adding harness support for additional testing environments

## Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

### When does adding support for a test environment make sense?

To use component harnesses in the following environments, you can use Angular CDK's two built-in environments:
- Unit tests
- WebDriver end-to-end tests

To use a supported testing environment, read the [Creating harnesses for your components guide](guide/testing/creating-component-harnesses).

Otherwise, to add support for other environments, you need to define how to interact with a DOM element and how DOM interactions work in your environment. Continue reading to learn more.

### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

## Creating a `TestElement` implementation

Every test environment must define a `TestElement` implementation. The `TestElement` interface serves as an environment-agnostic representation of a DOM element. It enables harnesses to interact with DOM elements regardless of the underlying environment. Because some environments don't support interacting with DOM elements synchronously (e.g. WebDriver), all `TestElement` methods are asynchronous, returning a `Promise` with the result of the operation.

`TestElement` offers a number of methods to interact with the underlying DOM such as `blur()`, `click()`, `getAttribute()`, and more. See the [TestElement API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#TestElement) for the full list of methods.

The `TestElement` interface consists largely of methods that resemble methods available on `HTMLElement`. Similar methods exist in most test environments, which makes implementing the methods fairly straightforward. However, one important difference to note when implementing the `sendKeys` method, is that the key codes in the `TestKey` enum likely differ from the key codes used in the test environment. Environment authors should maintain a mapping from `TestKey` codes to the codes used in the particular testing environment.

The [UnitTestElement](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/testing/testbed/unit-test-element.ts#L33) and [SeleniumWebDriverElement](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver/selenium-webdriver-keys.ts#L16) implementations in Angular CDK serve as good examples of implementations of this interface.

## Creating a `HarnessEnvironment` implementation
Test authors use `HarnessEnvironment` to create component harness instances for use in tests. `HarnessEnvironment` is an abstract class that must be extended to create a concrete subclass for the new environment. When supporting a new test environment, create a `HarnessEnvironment` subclass that adds concrete implementations for all abstract members.

`HarnessEnvironment` has a generic type parameter: `HarnessEnvironment<E>`. This parameter, `E`, represents the raw element type of the environment. For example, this parameter is Element for unit test environments.

The following are the abstract methods that must be implemented:

| Method                                                        | Description           |
|:---                                                           | :---                  |
| `abstract getDocumentRoot(): E`                               | Gets the root element for the environment (e.g. `document.body`). |
| `abstract createTestElement(element: E): TestElement`         | Creates a `TestElement` for the given raw element. |
| `abstract createEnvironment(element: E): HarnessEnvironment`  | Creates a `HarnessEnvironment` rooted at the given raw element. |
| `abstract getAllRawElements(selector: string): Promise<E[]>`  | Gets all of the raw elements under the root element of the environment matching the given selector. |
| `abstract forceStabilize(): Promise<void>`                    | Gets a `Promise` that resolves when the `NgZone` is stable. Additionally, if applicable, tells `NgZone` to stabilize (e.g. calling `flush()` in a `fakeAsync` test). |
| `abstract waitForTasksOutsideAngular(): Promise<void>`        | Gets a `Promise` that resolves when the parent zone of `NgZone` is stable. |

In addition to implementing the missing methods, this class should provide a way for test authors to get `ComponentHarness` instances. You should define a protected constructor and provide a static method called `loader` that returns a `HarnessLoader` instance. This allows test authors to write code like: `SomeHarnessEnvironment.loader().getHarness(...)`. Depending on the needs of the particular environment, the class may provide several different static methods or require arguments to be passed. (e.g. the `loader` method on `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` takes a `ComponentFixture`, and the class provides additional static methods called `documentRootLoader` and `harnessForFixture`).

The [`TestbedHarnessEnvironment`](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/testing/testbed/testbed-harness-environment.ts#L89) and [SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/main/src/cdk/testing/selenium-webdriver/selenium-web-driver-harness-environment.ts#L71) implementations in Angular CDK serve as good examples of implementations of this interface.

## Handling auto change detection
In order to support the `manualChangeDetection` and parallel APIs, your environment should install a handler for the auto change detection status.

When your environment wants to start handling the auto change detection status it can call `handleAutoChangeDetectionStatus(handler)`. The handler function will receive a `AutoChangeDetectionStatus` which has two properties `isDisabled` and `onDetectChangesNow()`. See the [AutoChangeDetectionStatus API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#AutoChangeDetectionStatus) for more information.
If your environment wants to stop handling auto change detection status it can call `stopHandlingAutoChangeDetectionStatus()`.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/testing/components-basics.md
================================================
# Basics of testing components

A component, unlike all other parts of an Angular application, combines an HTML template and a TypeScript class.
The component truly is the template and the class *working together*.
To adequately test a component, you should test that they work together as intended.

Such tests require creating the component's host element in the browser DOM, as Angular does, and investigating the component class's interaction with the DOM as described by its template.

The Angular `TestBed` facilitates this kind of testing as you'll see in the following sections.
But in many cases, *testing the component class alone*, without DOM involvement, can validate much of the component's behavior in a straightforward, more obvious way.

## Component DOM testing

A component is more than just its class.
A component interacts with the DOM and with other components.
Classes alone cannot tell you if the component is going to render properly, respond to user input and gestures, or integrate with its parent and child components.

* Is `Lightswitch.clicked()` bound to anything such that the user can invoke it?
* Is the `Lightswitch.message` displayed?
* Can the user actually select the hero displayed by `DashboardHeroComponent`?
* Is the hero name displayed as expected \(such as uppercase\)?
* Is the welcome message displayed by the template of `WelcomeComponent`?

These might not be troubling questions for the preceding simple components illustrated.
But many components have complex interactions with the DOM elements described in their templates, causing HTML to appear and disappear as the component state changes.

To answer these kinds of questions, you have to create the DOM elements associated with the components, you must examine the DOM to confirm that component state displays properly at the appropriate times, and you must simulate user interaction with the screen to determine whether those interactions cause the component to behave as expected.

To write these kinds of test, you'll use additional features of the `TestBed` as well as other testing helpers.

### CLI-generated tests

The CLI creates an initial test file for you by default when you ask it to generate a new component.

For example, the following CLI command generates a `BannerComponent` in the `app/banner` folder \(with inline template and styles\):

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate component banner --inline-template --inline-style --module app

</docs-code>

It also generates an initial test file for the component, `banner-external.component.spec.ts`, that looks like this:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (initial)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v1"/>

HELPFUL: Because `compileComponents` is asynchronous, it uses the [`waitForAsync`](api/core/testing/waitForAsync) utility function imported from `@angular/core/testing`.

Refer to the [waitForAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#waitForAsync) section for more details.

### Reduce the setup

Only the last three lines of this file actually test the component and all they do is assert that Angular can create the component.

The rest of the file is boilerplate setup code anticipating more advanced tests that *might* become necessary if the component evolves into something substantial.

You'll learn about these advanced test features in the following sections.
For now, you can radically reduce this test file to a more manageable size:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts (minimal)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v2"/>

In this example, the metadata object passed to `TestBed.configureTestingModule` simply declares `BannerComponent`, the component to test.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="configureTestingModule"/>

HELPFUL: There's no need to declare or import anything else.
The default test module is pre-configured with something like the `BrowserModule` from `@angular/platform-browser`.

Later you'll call `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` with imports, providers, and more declarations to suit your testing needs.
Optional `override` methods can further fine-tune aspects of the configuration.

### `createComponent()`

After configuring `TestBed`, you call its `createComponent()` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="createComponent"/>

`TestBed.createComponent()` creates an instance of the `BannerComponent`, adds a corresponding element to the test-runner DOM, and returns a [`ComponentFixture`](#componentfixture).

IMPORTANT: Do not re-configure `TestBed` after calling `createComponent`.

The `createComponent` method freezes the current `TestBed` definition, closing it to further configuration.

You cannot call any more `TestBed` configuration methods, not `configureTestingModule()`, nor `get()`, nor any of the `override...` methods.
If you try, `TestBed` throws an error.

### `ComponentFixture`

The [ComponentFixture](api/core/testing/ComponentFixture) is a test harness for interacting with the created component and its corresponding element.

Access the component instance through the fixture and confirm it exists with a Jasmine expectation:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="componentInstance"/>

### `beforeEach()`

You will add more tests as this component evolves.
Rather than duplicate the `TestBed` configuration for each test, you refactor to pull the setup into a Jasmine `beforeEach()` and some supporting variables:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v3"/>

Now add a test that gets the component's element from `fixture.nativeElement` and looks for the expected text.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-2"/>

### `nativeElement`

The value of `ComponentFixture.nativeElement` has the `any` type.
Later you'll encounter the `DebugElement.nativeElement` and it too has the `any` type.

Angular can't know at compile time what kind of HTML element the `nativeElement` is or if it even is an HTML element.
The application might be running on a *non-browser platform*, such as the server or a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), where the element might have a diminished API or not exist at all.

The tests in this guide are designed to run in a browser so a `nativeElement` value will always be an `HTMLElement` or one of its derived classes.

Knowing that it is an `HTMLElement` of some sort, use the standard HTML `querySelector` to dive deeper into the element tree.

Here's another test that calls `HTMLElement.querySelector` to get the paragraph element and look for the banner text:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-3"/>

### `DebugElement`

The Angular *fixture* provides the component's element directly through the `fixture.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="nativeElement"/>

This is actually a convenience method, implemented as `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="debugElement-nativeElement"/>

There's a good reason for this circuitous path to the element.

The properties of the `nativeElement` depend upon the runtime environment.
You could be running these tests on a *non-browser* platform that doesn't have a DOM or whose DOM-emulation doesn't support the full `HTMLElement` API.

Angular relies on the `DebugElement` abstraction to work safely across *all supported platforms*.
Instead of creating an HTML element tree, Angular creates a `DebugElement` tree that wraps the *native elements* for the runtime platform.
The `nativeElement` property unwraps the `DebugElement` and returns the platform-specific element object.

Because the sample tests for this guide are designed to run only in a browser, a `nativeElement` in these tests is always an `HTMLElement` whose familiar methods and properties you can explore within a test.

Here's the previous test, re-implemented with `fixture.debugElement.nativeElement`:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-4"/>

The `DebugElement` has other methods and properties that are useful in tests, as you'll see elsewhere in this guide.

You import the `DebugElement` symbol from the Angular core library.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-debug-element"/>

### `By.css()`

Although the tests in this guide all run in the browser, some applications might run on a different platform at least some of the time.

For example, the component might render first on the server as part of a strategy to make the application launch faster on poorly connected devices.
The server-side renderer might not support the full HTML element API.
If it doesn't support `querySelector`, the previous test could fail.

The `DebugElement` offers query methods that work for all supported platforms.
These query methods take a *predicate* function that returns `true` when a node in the `DebugElement` tree matches the selection criteria.

You create a *predicate* with the help of a `By` class imported from a library for the runtime platform.
Here's the `By` import for the browser platform:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-by"/>

The following example re-implements the previous test with `DebugElement.query()` and the browser's `By.css` method.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-initial.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="v4-test-5"/>

Some noteworthy observations:

* The `By.css()` static method selects `DebugElement` nodes with a [standard CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors 'CSS selectors').
* The query returns a `DebugElement` for the paragraph.
* You must unwrap that result to get the paragraph element.

When you're filtering by CSS selector and only testing properties of a browser's *native element*, the `By.css` approach might be overkill.

It's often more straightforward and clear to filter with a standard `HTMLElement` method such as `querySelector()` or `querySelectorAll()`.



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/testing/components-scenarios.md
================================================
# Component testing scenarios

This guide explores common component testing use cases.

## Component binding

In the example application, the `BannerComponent` presents static title text in the HTML template.

After a few changes, the `BannerComponent` presents a dynamic title by binding to the component's `title` property like this.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.ts" visibleRegion="component"/>

As minimal as this is, you decide to add a test to confirm that component actually displays the right content where you think it should.

### Query for the `<h1>`

You'll write a sequence of tests that inspect the value of the `<h1>` element that wraps the *title* property interpolation binding.

You update the `beforeEach` to find that element with a standard HTML `querySelector` and assign it to the `h1` variable.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

### `createComponent()` does not bind data

For your first test you'd like to see that the screen displays the default `title`.
Your instinct is to write a test that immediately inspects the `<h1>` like this:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="expect-h1-default-v1"/>

*That test fails* with the message:

<docs-code language="javascript">

expected '' to contain 'Test Tour of Heroes'.

</docs-code>

Binding happens when Angular performs **change detection**.

In production, change detection kicks in automatically when Angular creates a component or the user enters a keystroke, for example.

The `TestBed.createComponent` does not trigger change detection by default; a fact confirmed in the revised test:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-w-o-detect-changes"/>

### `detectChanges()`

You can tell the `TestBed` to perform data binding by calling `fixture.detectChanges()`.
Only then does the `<h1>` have the expected title.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="expect-h1-default"/>

Delayed change detection is intentional and useful.
It gives the tester an opportunity to inspect and change the state of the component *before Angular initiates data binding and calls [lifecycle hooks](guide/components/lifecycle)*.

Here's another test that changes the component's `title` property *before* calling `fixture.detectChanges()`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="after-change"/>

### Automatic change detection

The `BannerComponent` tests frequently call `detectChanges`.
Many testers prefer that the Angular test environment run change detection automatically like it does in production.

That's possible by configuring the `TestBed` with the `ComponentFixtureAutoDetect` provider.
First import it from the testing utility library:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (import)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="import-ComponentFixtureAutoDetect"/>

Then add it to the `providers` array of the testing module configuration:

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (AutoDetect)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="auto-detect"/>

HELPFUL: You can also use the `fixture.autoDetectChanges()` function instead if you only want to enable automatic change detection
after making updates to the state of the fixture's component. In addition, automatic change detection is on by default
when using `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection` and turning it off is not recommended.

Here are three tests that illustrate how automatic change detection works.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts (AutoDetect Tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner.component.detect-changes.spec.ts" visibleRegion="auto-detect-tests"/>

The first test shows the benefit of automatic change detection.

The second and third test reveal an important limitation.
The Angular testing environment does not run change detection synchronously when updates happen inside the test case that changed the component's `title`.
The test must call `await fixture.whenStable` to wait for another round of change detection.

HELPFUL: Angular does not know about direct updates to values that are not signals. The easiest way to ensure that
change detection will be scheduled is to use signals for values read in the template.

### Change an input value with `dispatchEvent()`

To simulate user input, find the input element and set its `value` property.

But there is an essential, intermediate step.

Angular doesn't know that you set the input element's `value` property.
It won't read that property until you raise the element's `input` event by calling `dispatchEvent()`.

The following example demonstrates the proper sequence.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (pipe test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="title-case-pipe"/>

## Component with external files

The preceding `BannerComponent` is defined with an *inline template* and *inline css*, specified in the `@Component.template` and `@Component.styles` properties respectively.

Many components specify *external templates* and *external css* with the `@Component.templateUrl` and `@Component.styleUrls` properties respectively, as the following variant of `BannerComponent` does.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.ts (metadata)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.ts" visibleRegion="metadata"/>

This syntax tells the Angular compiler to read the external files during component compilation.

That's not a problem when you run the CLI `ng test` command because it *compiles the application before running the tests*.

However, if you run the tests in a **non-CLI environment**, tests of this component might fail.
For example, if you run the `BannerComponent` tests in a web coding environment such as [plunker](https://plnkr.co), you'll see a message like this one:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: This test module uses the component BannerComponent
which is using a "templateUrl" or "styleUrls", but they were never compiled.
Please call "TestBed.compileComponents" before your test.

</docs-code>

You get this test failure message when the runtime environment compiles the source code *during the tests themselves*.

To correct the problem, call `compileComponents()` as explained in the following [Calling compileComponents](#calling-compilecomponents) section.

## Component with a dependency

Components often have service dependencies.

The `WelcomeComponent` displays a welcome message to the logged-in user.
It knows who the user is based on a property of the injected `UserService`:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.ts"/>

The `WelcomeComponent` has decision logic that interacts with the service, logic that makes this component worth testing.

### Provide service test doubles

A *component-under-test* doesn't have to be provided with real services.

Injecting the real `UserService` could be difficult.
The real service might ask the user for login credentials and attempt to reach an authentication server.
These behaviors can be hard to intercept. Be aware that using test doubles makes the test behave differently from production so use them sparingly.

### Get injected services

The tests need access to the `UserService` injected into the `WelcomeComponent`.

Angular has a hierarchical injection system.
There can be injectors at multiple levels, from the root injector created by the `TestBed` down through the component tree.

The safest way to get the injected service, the way that ***always works***,
is to **get it from the injector of the *component-under-test***.
The component injector is a property of the fixture's `DebugElement`.

<docs-code header="WelcomeComponent's injector" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="injected-service"/>

HELPFUL: This is _usually_ not necessary. Services are often provided in the root or the TestBed overrides and can be retrieved more easily with `TestBed.inject()` (see below).

### `TestBed.inject()`

This is easier to remember and less verbose than retrieving a service using the fixture's `DebugElement`.

In this test suite, the *only* provider of `UserService` is the root testing module, so it is safe to call `TestBed.inject()` as follows:

<docs-code header="TestBed injector" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="inject-from-testbed" />

HELPFUL: For a use case in which `TestBed.inject()` does not work, see the [*Override component providers*](#override-component-providers) section that explains when and why you must get the service from the component's injector instead.

### Final setup and tests

Here's the complete `beforeEach()`, using `TestBed.inject()`:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

And here are some tests:

<docs-code header="app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/welcome/welcome.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

The first is a sanity test; it confirms that the `UserService` is called and working.

HELPFUL: The withContext function \(for example, `'expected name'`\) is an optional failure label.
If the expectation fails, Jasmine appends this label to the expectation failure message.
In a spec with multiple expectations, it can help clarify what went wrong and which expectation failed.

The remaining tests confirm the logic of the component when the service returns different values.
The second test validates the effect of changing the user name.
The third test checks that the component displays the proper message when there is no logged-in user.

## Component with async service

In this sample, the `AboutComponent` template hosts a `TwainComponent`.
The `TwainComponent` displays Mark Twain quotes.

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.ts (template)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.ts" visibleRegion="template" />

HELPFUL: The value of the component's `quote` property passes through an `AsyncPipe`.
That means the property returns either a `Promise` or an `Observable`.

In this example, the `TwainComponent.getQuote()` method tells you that the `quote` property returns an `Observable`.

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.ts (getQuote)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.ts" visibleRegion="get-quote"/>

The `TwainComponent` gets quotes from an injected `TwainService`.
The component starts the returned `Observable` with a placeholder value \(`'...'`\), before the service can return its first quote.

The `catchError` intercepts service errors, prepares an error message, and returns the placeholder value on the success channel.

These are all features you'll want to test.

### Testing with a spy

When testing a component, only the service's public API should matter.
In general, tests themselves should not make calls to remote servers.
They should emulate such calls.
The setup in this `app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts` shows one way to do that:

<docs-code header="app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

Focus on the spy.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="spy"/>

The spy is designed such that any call to `getQuote` receives an observable with a test quote.
Unlike the real `getQuote()` method, this spy bypasses the server and returns a synchronous observable whose value is available immediately.

You can write many useful tests with this spy, even though its `Observable` is synchronous.

HELPFUL: It is best to limit the usage of spies to only what is necessary for the test. Creating mocks or spies for more than what's necessary can be brittle. As the component and injectable evolves, the unrelated tests can fail because they no longer mock enough behaviors that would otherwise not affect the test.


### Async test with `fakeAsync()`

To use `fakeAsync()` functionality, you must import `zone.js/testing` in your test setup file.
If you created your project with the Angular CLI, `zone-testing` is already imported in `src/test.ts`.

The following test confirms the expected behavior when the service returns an `ErrorObservable`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="error-test"/>

HELPFUL: The `it()` function receives an argument of the following form.

<docs-code language="javascript">

fakeAsync(() => { /*test body*/ })

</docs-code>

The `fakeAsync()` function enables a linear coding style by running the test body in a special `fakeAsync test zone`.
The test body appears to be synchronous.
There is no nested syntax \(like a `Promise.then()`\) to disrupt the flow of control.

HELPFUL: Limitation: The `fakeAsync()` function won't work if the test body makes an `XMLHttpRequest` \(XHR\) call.
XHR calls within a test are rare, but if you need to call XHR, see the [`waitForAsync()`](#waitForAsync) section.

IMPORTANT: Be aware that asynchronous tasks that happen inside the `fakeAsync` zone need to be manually executed with `flush` or `tick`. If you attempt to
wait for them to complete (i.e. using `fixture.whenStable`) without using the
`fakeAsync` test helpers to advance time, your test will likely fail. See below for more information.

### The `tick()` function

You do have to call [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) to advance the virtual clock.

Calling [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) simulates the passage of time until all pending asynchronous activities finish.
In this case, it waits for the observable's `setTimeout()`.

The [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) function accepts `millis` and `tickOptions` as parameters. The `millis` parameter specifies how much the virtual clock advances and defaults to `0` if not provided.
For example, if you have a `setTimeout(fn, 100)` in a `fakeAsync()` test, you need to use `tick(100)` to trigger the fn callback.
The optional `tickOptions` parameter has a property named `processNewMacroTasksSynchronously`. The `processNewMacroTasksSynchronously` property represents whether to invoke new generated macro tasks when ticking and defaults to `true`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick"/>

The [tick()](api/core/testing/tick) function is one of the Angular testing utilities that you import with `TestBed`.
It's a companion to `fakeAsync()` and you can only call it within a `fakeAsync()` body.

### tickOptions

In this example, you have a new macro task, the nested `setTimeout` function. By default, when the `tick` is setTimeout, `outside` and `nested` will both be triggered.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick-new-macro-task-sync"/>

In some case, you don't want to trigger the new macro task when ticking. You can use `tick(millis, {processNewMacroTasksSynchronously: false})` to not invoke a new macro task.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-tick-new-macro-task-async"/>

### Comparing dates inside fakeAsync()

`fakeAsync()` simulates passage of time, which lets you calculate the difference between dates inside `fakeAsync()`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-date"/>

### jasmine.clock with fakeAsync()

Jasmine also provides a `clock` feature to mock dates.
Angular automatically runs tests that are run after `jasmine.clock().install()` is called inside a `fakeAsync()` method until `jasmine.clock().uninstall()` is called.
`fakeAsync()` is not needed and throws an error if nested.

By default, this feature is disabled.
To enable it, set a global flag before importing `zone-testing`.

If you use the Angular CLI, configure this flag in `src/test.ts`.

<docs-code language="typescript">

[window as any]('&lowbar;&lowbar;zone&lowbar;symbol__fakeAsyncPatchLock') = true;
import 'zone.js/testing';

</docs-code>

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-clock"/>

### Using the RxJS scheduler inside fakeAsync()

You can also use RxJS scheduler in `fakeAsync()` just like using `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`, but you need to import `zone.js/plugins/zone-patch-rxjs-fake-async` to patch RxJS scheduler.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/async-helper.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test-rxjs"/>

### Support more macroTasks

By default, `fakeAsync()` supports the following macro tasks.

* `setTimeout`
* `setInterval`
* `requestAnimationFrame`
* `webkitRequestAnimationFrame`
* `mozRequestAnimationFrame`

If you run other macro tasks such as `HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob()`, an *"Unknown macroTask scheduled in fake async test"* error is thrown.

<docs-code-multifile>
    <docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts (failing)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="without-toBlob-macrotask"/>
    <docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" visibleRegion="main"/>
</docs-code-multifile>

If you want to support such a case, you need to define the macro task you want to support in `beforeEach()`.
For example:

<docs-code header="src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="enable-toBlob-macrotask"/>

HELPFUL: In order to make the `<canvas>` element Zone.js-aware in your app, you need to import the `zone-patch-canvas` patch \(either in `polyfills.ts` or in the specific file that uses `<canvas>`\):

<docs-code header="src/polyfills.ts or src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/canvas.component.ts" visibleRegion="import-canvas-patch"/>

### Async observables

You might be satisfied with the test coverage of these tests.

However, you might be troubled by the fact that the real service doesn't quite behave this way.
The real service sends requests to a remote server.
A server takes time to respond and the response certainly won't be available immediately as in the previous two tests.

Your tests will reflect the real world more faithfully if you return an *asynchronous* observable from the `getQuote()` spy like this.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-setup"/>

### Async observable helpers

The async observable was produced by an `asyncData` helper.
The `asyncData` helper is a utility function that you'll have to write yourself, or copy this one from the sample code.

<docs-code header="testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" visibleRegion="async-data"/>

This helper's observable emits the `data` value in the next turn of the JavaScript engine.

The [RxJS `defer()` operator](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/defer.html) returns an observable.
It takes a factory function that returns either a promise or an observable.
When something subscribes to *defer*'s observable, it adds the subscriber to a new observable created with that factory.

The `defer()` operator transforms the `Promise.resolve()` into a new observable that, like `HttpClient`, emits once and completes.
Subscribers are unsubscribed after they receive the data value.

There's a similar helper for producing an async error.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/async-observable-helpers.ts" visibleRegion="async-error"/>

### More async tests

Now that the `getQuote()` spy is returning async observables, most of your tests will have to be async as well.

Here's a `fakeAsync()` test that demonstrates the data flow you'd expect in the real world.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="fake-async-test"/>

Notice that the quote element displays the placeholder value \(`'...'`\) after `ngOnInit()`.
The first quote hasn't arrived yet.

To flush the first quote from the observable, you call [tick()](api/core/testing/tick).
Then call `detectChanges()` to tell Angular to update the screen.

Then you can assert that the quote element displays the expected text.

### Async test without `fakeAsync()`

Here's the previous `fakeAsync()` test, re-written with the `async`.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/twain/twain.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-test"/>

### `whenStable`

The test must wait for the `getQuote()` observable to emit the next quote.
Instead of calling [tick()](api/core/testing/tick), it calls `fixture.whenStable()`.

The `fixture.whenStable()` returns a promise that resolves when the JavaScript engine's task queue becomes empty.
In this example, the task queue becomes empty when the observable emits the first quote.


## Component with inputs and outputs

A component with inputs and outputs typically appears inside the view template of a host component.
The host uses a property binding to set the input property and an event binding to listen to events raised by the output property.

The testing goal is to verify that such bindings work as expected.
The tests should set input values and listen for output events.

The `DashboardHeroComponent` is a tiny example of a component in this role.
It displays an individual hero provided by the `DashboardComponent`.
Clicking that hero tells the `DashboardComponent` that the user has selected the hero.

The `DashboardHeroComponent` is embedded in the `DashboardComponent` template like this:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html (excerpt)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.html" visibleRegion="dashboard-hero"/>

The `DashboardHeroComponent` appears in an `*ngFor` repeater, which sets each component's `hero` input property to the looping value and listens for the component's `selected` event.

Here's the component's full definition:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.ts (component)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.ts" visibleRegion="component"/>

While testing a component this simple has little intrinsic value, it's worth knowing how.
Use one of these approaches:

* Test it as used by `DashboardComponent`
* Test it as a standalone component
* Test it as used by a substitute for `DashboardComponent`

The immediate goal is to test the `DashboardHeroComponent`, not the `DashboardComponent`, so, try the second and third options.

### Test `DashboardHeroComponent` standalone

Here's the meat of the spec file setup.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup"/>

Notice how the setup code assigns a test hero \(`expectedHero`\) to the component's `hero` property, emulating the way the `DashboardComponent` would set it using the property binding in its repeater.

The following test verifies that the hero name is propagated to the template using a binding.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="name-test"/>

Because the [template](#dashboard-hero-component) passes the hero name through the Angular `UpperCasePipe`, the test must match the element value with the upper-cased name.

### Clicking

Clicking the hero should raise a `selected` event that the host component \(`DashboardComponent` presumably\) can hear:

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test"/>

The component's `selected` property returns an `EventEmitter`, which looks like an RxJS synchronous `Observable` to consumers.
The test subscribes to it *explicitly* just as the host component does *implicitly*.

If the component behaves as expected, clicking the hero's element should tell the component's `selected` property to emit the `hero` object.

The test detects that event through its subscription to `selected`.

### `triggerEventHandler`

The `heroDe` in the previous test is a `DebugElement` that represents the hero `<div>`.

It has Angular properties and methods that abstract interaction with the native element.
This test calls the `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` with the "click" event name.
The "click" event binding responds by calling `DashboardHeroComponent.click()`.

The Angular `DebugElement.triggerEventHandler` can raise *any data-bound event* by its *event name*.
The second parameter is the event object passed to the handler.

The test triggered a "click" event.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="trigger-event-handler"/>

In this case, the test correctly assumes that the runtime event handler, the component's `click()` method, doesn't care about the event object.

HELPFUL: Other handlers are less forgiving.
For example, the `RouterLink` directive expects an object with a `button` property that identifies which mouse button, if any, was pressed during the click.
The `RouterLink` directive throws an error if the event object is missing.

### Click the element

The following test alternative calls the native element's own `click()` method, which is perfectly fine for *this component*.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test-2"/>

### `click()` helper

Clicking a button, an anchor, or an arbitrary HTML element is a common test task.

Make that consistent and straightforward by encapsulating the *click-triggering* process in a helper such as the following `click()` function:

<docs-code header="testing/index.ts (click helper)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/testing/index.ts" visibleRegion="click-event"/>

The first parameter is the *element-to-click*.
If you want, pass a custom event object as the second parameter.
The default is a partial [left-button mouse event object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/button) accepted by many handlers including the `RouterLink` directive.

IMPORTANT: The `click()` helper function is **not** one of the Angular testing utilities.
It's a function defined in *this guide's sample code*.
All of the sample tests use it.
If you like it, add it to your own collection of helpers.

Here's the previous test, rewritten using the click helper.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test with click helper)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="click-test-3"/>

## Component inside a test host

The previous tests played the role of the host `DashboardComponent` themselves.
But does the `DashboardHeroComponent` work correctly when properly data-bound to a host component?

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test host)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host"/>

The test host sets the component's `hero` input property with its test hero.
It binds the component's `selected` event with its `onSelected` handler, which records the emitted hero in its `selectedHero` property.

Later, the tests will be able to check `selectedHero` to verify that the `DashboardHeroComponent.selected` event emitted the expected hero.

The setup for the `test-host` tests is similar to the setup for the stand-alone tests:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test host setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host-setup"/>

This testing module configuration shows three important differences:

* It *imports* both the `DashboardHeroComponent` and the `TestHostComponent`
* It *creates* the `TestHostComponent` instead of the `DashboardHeroComponent`
* The `TestHostComponent` sets the `DashboardHeroComponent.hero` with a binding

The `createComponent` returns a `fixture` that holds an instance of `TestHostComponent` instead of an instance of `DashboardHeroComponent`.

Creating the `TestHostComponent` has the side effect of creating a `DashboardHeroComponent` because the latter appears within the template of the former.
The query for the hero element \(`heroEl`\) still finds it in the test DOM, albeit at greater depth in the element tree than before.

The tests themselves are almost identical to the stand-alone version:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (test-host)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-host-tests"/>

Only the selected event test differs.
It confirms that the selected `DashboardHeroComponent` hero really does find its way up through the event binding to the host component.

## Routing component

A *routing component* is a component that tells the `Router` to navigate to another component.
The `DashboardComponent` is a *routing component* because the user can navigate to the `HeroDetailComponent` by clicking on one of the *hero buttons* on the dashboard.

Angular provides test helpers to reduce boilerplate and more effectively test code which depends on `HttpClient`. The `provideRouter` function can be used directly in the test module as well.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="router-harness"/>

The following test clicks the displayed hero and confirms that we navigate to the expected URL.

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts (navigate test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="navigate-test"/>

## Routed components

A *routed component* is the destination of a `Router` navigation.
It can be trickier to test, especially when the route to the component *includes parameters*.
The `HeroDetailComponent` is a *routed component* that is the destination of such a route.

When a user clicks a *Dashboard* hero, the `DashboardComponent` tells the `Router` to navigate to `heroes/:id`.
The `:id` is a route parameter whose value is the `id` of the hero to edit.

The `Router` matches that URL to a route to the `HeroDetailComponent`.
It creates an `ActivatedRoute` object with the routing information and injects it into a new instance of the `HeroDetailComponent`.

Here are the services injected into `HeroDetailComponent`:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (inject)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="ctor"/>

The `HeroDetail` component needs the `id` parameter so it can fetch the corresponding hero using the `HeroDetailService`.
The component has to get the `id` from the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap` property which is an `Observable`.

It can't just reference the `id` property of the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap`.
The component has to *subscribe* to the `ActivatedRoute.paramMap` observable and be prepared for the `id` to change during its lifetime.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (constructor)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="ctor"/>

Tests can explore how the `HeroDetailComponent` responds to different `id` parameter values by navigating to different routes.

### Testing with the `RouterTestingHarness`

Here's a test demonstrating the component's behavior when the observed `id` refers to an existing hero:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (existing id)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="route-good-id"/>

HELPFUL: In the following section, the `createComponent()` method and `page` object are discussed.
Rely on your intuition for now.

When the `id` cannot be found, the component should re-route to the `HeroListComponent`.

The test suite setup provided the same router harness [described above](#routing-component).

This test expects the component to try to navigate to the `HeroListComponent`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (bad id)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="route-bad-id"/>

## Nested component tests

Component templates often have nested components, whose templates might contain more components.

The component tree can be very deep and sometimes the nested components play no role in testing the component at the top of the tree.

The `AppComponent`, for example, displays a navigation bar with anchors and their `RouterLink` directives.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.html"/>

To validate the links but not the navigation, you don't need the `Router` to navigate and you don't need the `<router-outlet>` to mark where the `Router` inserts *routed components*.

The `BannerComponent` and `WelcomeComponent` \(indicated by `<app-banner>` and `<app-welcome>`\) are also irrelevant.

Yet any test that creates the `AppComponent` in the DOM also creates instances of these three components and, if you let that happen, you'll have to configure the `TestBed` to create them.

If you neglect to declare them, the Angular compiler won't recognize the `<app-banner>`, `<app-welcome>`, and `<router-outlet>` tags in the `AppComponent` template and will throw an error.

If you declare the real components, you'll also have to declare *their* nested components and provide for *all* services injected in *any* component in the tree.

This section describes two techniques for minimizing the setup.
Use them, alone or in combination, to stay focused on testing the primary component.

### Stubbing unneeded components

In the first technique, you create and declare stub versions of the components and directive that play little or no role in the tests.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (stub declaration)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="component-stubs"/>

The stub selectors match the selectors for the corresponding real components.
But their templates and classes are empty.

Then declare them in the `TestBed` configuration next to the components, directives, and pipes that need to be real.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (TestBed stubs)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="testbed-stubs"/>

The `AppComponent` is the test subject, so of course you declare the real version.

The rest are stubs.

### `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA`

In the second approach, add `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` to the `TestBed.schemas` metadata.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-errors-schema"/>

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` tells the Angular compiler to ignore unrecognized elements and attributes.

The compiler recognizes the `<app-root>` element and the `routerLink` attribute because you declared a corresponding `AppComponent` and `RouterLink` in the `TestBed` configuration.

But the compiler won't throw an error when it encounters `<app-banner>`, `<app-welcome>`, or `<router-outlet>`.
It simply renders them as empty tags and the browser ignores them.

You no longer need the stub components.

### Use both techniques together

These are techniques for *Shallow Component Testing*, so-named because they reduce the visual surface of the component to just those elements in the component's template that matter for tests.

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` approach is the easier of the two but don't overuse it.

The `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` also prevents the compiler from telling you about the missing components and attributes that you omitted inadvertently or misspelled.
You could waste hours chasing phantom bugs that the compiler would have caught in an instant.

The *stub component* approach has another advantage.
While the stubs in *this* example were empty, you could give them stripped-down templates and classes if your tests need to interact with them in some way.

In practice you will combine the two techniques in the same setup, as seen in this example.

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (mixed setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="mixed-setup"/>

The Angular compiler creates the `BannerStubComponent` for the `<app-banner>` element and applies the `RouterLink` to the anchors with the `routerLink` attribute, but it ignores the `<app-welcome>` and `<router-outlet>` tags.

### `By.directive` and injected directives

A little more setup triggers the initial data binding and gets references to the navigation links:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (test setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-setup"/>

Three points of special interest:

* Locate the anchor elements with an attached directive using `By.directive`
* The query returns `DebugElement` wrappers around the matching elements
* Each `DebugElement` exposes a dependency injector with the specific instance of the directive attached to that element

The `AppComponent` links to validate are as follows:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.html (navigation links)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.html" visibleRegion="links"/>

Here are some tests that confirm those links are wired to the `routerLink` directives as expected:

<docs-code header="app/app.component.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/app.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="tests"/>

## Use a `page` object

The `HeroDetailComponent` is a simple view with a title, two hero fields, and two buttons.

But there's plenty of template complexity even in this simple form.

<docs-code
  path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.html" header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.html"/>

Tests that exercise the component need …

* To wait until a hero arrives before elements appear in the DOM
* A reference to the title text
* A reference to the name input box to inspect and set it
* References to the two buttons so they can click them

Even a small form such as this one can produce a mess of tortured conditional setup and CSS element selection.

Tame the complexity with a `Page` class that handles access to component properties and encapsulates the logic that sets them.

Here is such a `Page` class for the `hero-detail.component.spec.ts`

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (Page)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="page"/>

Now the important hooks for component manipulation and inspection are neatly organized and accessible from an instance of `Page`.

A `createComponent` method creates a `page` object and fills in the blanks once the `hero` arrives.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (createComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="create-component"/>

Here are a few more `HeroDetailComponent` tests to reinforce the point.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (selected tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="selected-tests"/>

## Calling `compileComponents()`

HELPFUL: Ignore this section if you *only* run tests with the CLI `ng test` command because the CLI compiles the application before running the tests.

If you run tests in a **non-CLI environment**, the tests might fail with a message like this one:

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: This test module uses the component BannerComponent
which is using a "templateUrl" or "styleUrls", but they were never compiled.
Please call "TestBed.compileComponents" before your test.

</docs-code>

The root of the problem is at least one of the components involved in the test specifies an external template or CSS file as the following version of the `BannerComponent` does.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.ts (external template & css)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.ts"/>

The test fails when the `TestBed` tries to create the component.

<docs-code avoid header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (setup that fails)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-may-fail"/>

Recall that the application hasn't been compiled.
So when you call `createComponent()`, the `TestBed` compiles implicitly.

That's not a problem when the source code is in memory.
But the `BannerComponent` requires external files that the compiler must read from the file system, an inherently *asynchronous* operation.

If the `TestBed` were allowed to continue, the tests would run and fail mysteriously before the compiler could finish.

The preemptive error message tells you to compile explicitly with `compileComponents()`.

### `compileComponents()` is async

You must call `compileComponents()` within an asynchronous test function.

CRITICAL: If you neglect to make the test function async (for example, forget to use `waitForAsync()` as described), you'll see this error message

<docs-code hideCopy language="shell">

Error: ViewDestroyedError: Attempt to use a destroyed view

</docs-code>

A typical approach is to divide the setup logic into two separate `beforeEach()` functions:

| Functions                   | Details                      |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Asynchronous `beforeEach()` | Compiles the components      |
| Synchronous `beforeEach()`  | Performs the remaining setup |

### The async `beforeEach`

Write the first async `beforeEach` like this.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (async beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="async-before-each"/>

The `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` method returns the `TestBed` class so you can chain calls to other `TestBed` static methods such as `compileComponents()`.

In this example, the `BannerComponent` is the only component to compile.
Other examples configure the testing module with multiple components and might import application modules that hold yet more components.
Any of them could require external files.

The `TestBed.compileComponents` method asynchronously compiles all components configured in the testing module.

IMPORTANT: Do not re-configure the `TestBed` after calling `compileComponents()`.

Calling `compileComponents()` closes the current `TestBed` instance to further configuration.
You cannot call any more `TestBed` configuration methods, not `configureTestingModule()` nor any of the `override...` methods.
The `TestBed` throws an error if you try.

Make `compileComponents()` the last step before calling `TestBed.createComponent()`.

### The synchronous `beforeEach`

The second, synchronous `beforeEach()` contains the remaining setup steps, which include creating the component and querying for elements to inspect.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (synchronous beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="sync-before-each"/>

Count on the test runner to wait for the first asynchronous `beforeEach` to finish before calling the second.

### Consolidated setup

You can consolidate the two `beforeEach()` functions into a single, async `beforeEach()`.

The `compileComponents()` method returns a promise so you can perform the synchronous setup tasks *after* compilation by moving the synchronous code after the `await` keyword, where the promise has been resolved.

<docs-code header="app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts (one beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/banner/banner-external.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="one-before-each"/>

### `compileComponents()` is harmless

There's no harm in calling `compileComponents()` when it's not required.

The component test file generated by the CLI calls `compileComponents()` even though it is never required when running `ng test`.

The tests in this guide only call `compileComponents` when necessary.

## Setup with module imports

Earlier component tests configured the testing module with a few `declarations` like this:

<docs-code header="app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts (configure TestBed)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-hero.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="config-testbed"/>

The `DashboardComponent` is simple.
It needs no help.
But more complex components often depend on other components, directives, pipes, and providers and these must be added to the testing module too.

Fortunately, the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` parameter parallels the metadata passed to the `@NgModule` decorator which means you can also specify `providers` and `imports`.

The `HeroDetailComponent` requires a lot of help despite its small size and simple construction.
In addition to the support it receives from the default testing module `CommonModule`, it needs:

* `NgModel` and friends in the `FormsModule` to enable two-way data binding
* The `TitleCasePipe` from the `shared` folder
* The Router services
* The Hero data access services

One approach is to configure the testing module from the individual pieces as in this example:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (FormsModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-forms-module"/>

HELPFUL: Notice that the `beforeEach()` is asynchronous and calls `TestBed.compileComponents` because the `HeroDetailComponent` has an external template and css file.

As explained in [Calling `compileComponents()`](#calling-compilecomponents), these tests could be run in a non-CLI environment where Angular would have to compile them in the browser.

### Import a shared module

Because many application components need the `FormsModule` and the `TitleCasePipe`, the developer created a `SharedModule` to combine these and other frequently requested parts.

The test configuration can use the `SharedModule` too as seen in this alternative setup:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (SharedModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-shared-module"/>

It's a bit tighter and smaller, with fewer import statements, which are not shown in this example.

### Import a feature module

The `HeroDetailComponent` is part of the `HeroModule` [Feature Module](guide/ngmodules/feature-modules) that aggregates more of the interdependent pieces including the `SharedModule`.
Try a test configuration that imports the `HeroModule` like this one:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (HeroModule setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-hero-module"/>

Only the *test doubles* in the `providers` remain.
Even the `HeroDetailComponent` declaration is gone.

In fact, if you try to declare it, Angular will throw an error because `HeroDetailComponent` is declared in both the `HeroModule` and the `DynamicTestModule` created by the `TestBed`.

HELPFUL: Importing the component's feature module can be the best way to configure tests when there are many mutual dependencies within the module and the module is small, as feature modules tend to be.

## Override component providers

The `HeroDetailComponent` provides its own `HeroDetailService`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts (prototype)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.ts" visibleRegion="prototype"/>

It's not possible to stub the component's `HeroDetailService` in the `providers` of the `TestBed.configureTestingModule`.
Those are providers for the *testing module*, not the component.
They prepare the dependency injector at the *fixture level*.

Angular creates the component with its *own* injector, which is a *child* of the fixture injector.
It registers the component's providers \(the `HeroDetailService` in this case\) with the child injector.

A test cannot get to child injector services from the fixture injector.
And `TestBed.configureTestingModule` can't configure them either.

Angular has created new instances of the real `HeroDetailService` all along!

HELPFUL: These tests could fail or timeout if the `HeroDetailService` made its own XHR calls to a remote server.
There might not be a remote server to call.

Fortunately, the `HeroDetailService` delegates responsibility for remote data access to an injected `HeroService`.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.service.ts (prototype)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.service.ts" visibleRegion="prototype"/>

The [previous test configuration](#import-a-feature-module) replaces the real `HeroService` with a `TestHeroService` that intercepts server requests and fakes their responses.

What if you aren't so lucky.
What if faking the `HeroService` is hard?
What if `HeroDetailService` makes its own server requests?

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can replace the component's `providers` with easy-to-manage *test doubles* as seen in the following setup variation:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (Override setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="setup-override"/>

Notice that `TestBed.configureTestingModule` no longer provides a fake `HeroService` because it's [not needed](#spy-stub).

### The `overrideComponent` method

Focus on the `overrideComponent` method.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (overrideComponent)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="override-component-method"/>

It takes two arguments: the component type to override \(`HeroDetailComponent`\) and an override metadata object.
The [override metadata object](guide/testing/utility-apis#metadata-override-object) is a generic defined as follows:

<docs-code language="javascript">

type MetadataOverride<T> = {
  add?: Partial<T>;
  remove?: Partial<T>;
  set?: Partial<T>;
};

</docs-code>

A metadata override object can either add-and-remove elements in metadata properties or completely reset those properties.
This example resets the component's `providers` metadata.

The type parameter, `T`, is the kind of metadata you'd pass to the `@Component` decorator:

<docs-code language="javascript">

selector?: string;
template?: string;
templateUrl?: string;
providers?: any[];
…

</docs-code>

### Provide a *spy stub* (`HeroDetailServiceSpy`)

This example completely replaces the component's `providers` array with a new array containing a `HeroDetailServiceSpy`.

The `HeroDetailServiceSpy` is a stubbed version of the real `HeroDetailService` that fakes all necessary features of that service.
It neither injects nor delegates to the lower level `HeroService` so there's no need to provide a test double for that.

The related `HeroDetailComponent` tests will assert that methods of the `HeroDetailService` were called by spying on the service methods.
Accordingly, the stub implements its methods as spies:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (HeroDetailServiceSpy)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="hds-spy"/>

### The override tests

Now the tests can control the component's hero directly by manipulating the spy-stub's `testHero` and confirm that service methods were called.

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (override tests)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="override-tests"/>

### More overrides

The `TestBed.overrideComponent` method can be called multiple times for the same or different components.
The `TestBed` offers similar `overrideDirective`, `overrideModule`, and `overridePipe` methods for digging into and replacing parts of these other classes.

Explore the options and combinations on your own.

# Creating harnesses for your components

## Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

### When does creating a test harness make sense?

The Angular team recommends creating component test harnesses for shared components that are used in many places and have some user interactivity. This most commonly applies to widget libraries and similar reusable components. Harnesses are valuable for these cases because they provide the consumers of these shared components a well- supported API for interacting with a component. Tests that use harnesses can avoid depending on unreliable implementation details of these shared components, such as DOM structure and specific event listeners.

For components that appear in only one place, such as a page in an application, harnesses don't provide as much benefit. In these situations, a component's tests can reasonably depend on the implementation details of this component, as the tests and components are updated at the same time. However, harnesses still provide some value if you would use the harness in both unit and end-to-end tests.

### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

## Extending `ComponentHarness`

The abstract `ComponentHarness` class is the base class for all component harnesses. To create a custom component harness, extend `ComponentHarness` and implement the static property `hostSelector`.

The `hostSelector` property identifies elements in the DOM that match this harness subclass. In most cases, the `hostSelector` should be the same as the selector of the corresponding `Component` or `Directive`. For example, consider a simple popup component:

<docs-code language="typescript">
@Component({
  selector: 'my-popup',
  template: `
    <button (click)="toggle()">{{triggerText()}}</button>
    @if (isOpen()) {
      <div class="my-popup-content"><ng-content></ng-content></div>
    }
  `
})
class MyPopup {
  triggerText = input('');

  isOpen = signal(false);

  toggle() {
    this.isOpen.update((value) => !value);
  }
}
</docs-code>

In this case, a minimal harness for the component would look like the following:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';
}
</docs-code>

While `ComponentHarness` subclasses require only the `hostSelector` property, most harnesses should also implement a static `with` method to generate `HarnessPredicate` instances. The [filtering harnesses section](guide/testing/using-component-harnesses#filtering-harnesses) covers this in more detail.

## Finding elements in the component's DOM

Each instance of a `ComponentHarness` subclass represents a particular instance of the corresponding component. You can access the component's host element via the `host() `method from the `ComponentHarness` base class.

`ComponentHarness` also offers several methods for locating elements within the component's DOM. These methods are `locatorFor()`, `locatorForOptional()`, and `locatorForAll()`. These methods create functions that find elements, they do not directly find elements. This approach safeguards against caching references to out-of-date elements. For example, when an `ngIf` hides and then shows an element, the result is a new DOM element; using functions ensures that tests always reference the current state of the DOM.

See the [ComponentHarness API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#ComponentHarness) for the full list details of the different `locatorFor` methods.

For example, the `MyPopupHarness` example discussed above could provide methods to get the trigger and content elements as follows:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

  /** Gets the trigger element */
  getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');

  /** Gets the content element. */
  getContentElement = this.locatorForOptional('.my-popup-content');
}
</docs-code>

## Working with `TestElement` instances

`TestElement` is an abstraction designed to work across different test environments (Unit tests, WebDriver, etc). When using harnesses, you should perform all DOM interaction via this interface. Other means of accessing DOM elements, such as `document.querySelector()`, do not work in all test environments.

`TestElement` has a number of methods to interact with the underlying DOM, such as `blur()`, `click()`, `getAttribute()`, and more. See the [TestElement API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#TestElement) for the full list of methods.

Do not expose `TestElement` instances to harness users unless it's an element the component consumer defines directly, such as the component's host element. Exposing `TestElement` instances for internal elements leads users to depend on a component's internal DOM structure.

Instead, provide more narrow-focused methods for specific actions the end-user may take or particular state they may observe. For example, `MyPopupHarness` from previous sections could provide methods like `toggle` and `isOpen`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

  protected getTriggerElement = this.locatorFor('button');
  protected getContentElement = this.locatorForOptional('.my-popup-content');

  /** Toggles the open state of the popup. */
  async toggle() {
    const trigger = await this.getTriggerElement();
    return trigger.click();
  }

  /** Checks if the popup us open. */
  async isOpen() {
    const content = await this.getContentElement();
    return !!content;
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Loading harnesses for subcomponents

Larger components often compose sub-components. You can reflect this structure in a component's harness as well. Each of the `locatorFor` methods on `ComponentHarness` has an alternate signature that can be used for locating sub-harnesses rather than elements.

See the [ComponentHarness API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#ComponentHarness) for the full list of the different locatorFor methods.

For example, consider a menu build using the popup from above:

<docs-code language="typescript">
@Directive({
  selector: 'my-menu-item'
})
class MyMenuItem {}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-menu',
  template: `
    <my-popup>
      <ng-content></ng-content>
    </my-popup>
  `
})
class MyMenu {
  triggerText = input('');

  @ContentChildren(MyMenuItem) items: QueryList<MyMenuItem>;
}
</docs-code>

The harness for `MyMenu` can then take advantage of other harnesses for `MyPopup` and `MyMenuItem`:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

  protected getPopupHarness = this.locatorFor(MyPopupHarness);

  /** Gets the currently shown menu items (empty list if menu is closed). */
  getItems = this.locatorForAll(MyMenuItemHarness);

  /** Toggles open state of the menu. */
  async toggle() {
    const popupHarness = await this.getPopupHarness();
    return popupHarness.toggle();
  }
}

class MyMenuItemHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu-item';
}
</docs-code>

## Filtering harness instances with `HarnessPredicate`
When a page contains multiple instances of a particular component, you may want to filter based on some property of the component to get a particular component instance. For example, you may want a button with some specific text, or a menu with a specific ID. The `HarnessPredicate` class can capture criteria like this for a `ComponentHarness` subclass. While the test author is able to construct `HarnessPredicate` instances manually, it's easier when the `ComponentHarness` subclass provides a helper method to construct predicates for common filters.

You should create a static `with()` method on each `ComponentHarness` subclass that returns a `HarnessPredicate` for that class. This allows test authors to write easily understandable code, e.g. `loader.getHarness(MyMenuHarness.with({selector: '#menu1'}))`. In addition to the standard selector and ancestor options, the `with` method should add any other options that make sense for the particular subclass.

Harnesses that need to add additional options should extend the `BaseHarnessFilters` interface and additional optional properties as needed. `HarnessPredicate` provides several convenience methods for adding options: `stringMatches()`, `addOption()`, and `add()`. See the [HarnessPredicate API page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#HarnessPredicate) for the full description.

For example, when working with a menu it is useful to filter based on trigger text and to filter menu items based on their text:

<docs-code language="typescript">
interface MyMenuHarnessFilters extends BaseHarnessFilters {
  /** Filters based on the trigger text for the menu. */
  triggerText?: string | RegExp;
}

interface MyMenuItemHarnessFilters extends BaseHarnessFilters {
  /** Filters based on the text of the menu item. */
  text?: string | RegExp;
}

class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

  /** Creates a `HarnessPredicate` used to locate a particular `MyMenuHarness`. */
  static with(options: MyMenuHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<MyMenuHarness> {
    return new HarnessPredicate(MyMenuHarness, options)
        .addOption('trigger text', options.triggerText,
            (harness, text) => HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(harness.getTriggerText(), text));
  }

  protected getPopupHarness = this.locatorFor(MyPopupHarness);

  /** Gets the text of the menu trigger. */
  async getTriggerText(): Promise<string> {
    const popupHarness = await this.getPopupHarness();
    return popupHarness.getTriggerText();
  }
  ...
}

class MyMenuItemHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu-item';

  /** Creates a `HarnessPredicate` used to locate a particular `MyMenuItemHarness`. */
  static with(options: MyMenuItemHarnessFilters): HarnessPredicate<MyMenuItemHarness> {
    return new HarnessPredicate(MyMenuItemHarness, options)
        .addOption('text', options.text,
            (harness, text) => HarnessPredicate.stringMatches(harness.getText(), text));
  }

  /** Gets the text of the menu item. */
  async getText(): Promise<string> {
    const host = await this.host();
    return host.text();
  }
}
</docs-code>

You can pass a `HarnessPredicate` instead of a `ComponentHarness` class to any of the APIs on `HarnessLoader`, `LocatorFactory`, or `ComponentHarness`. This allows test authors to easily target a particular component instance when creating a harness instance. It also allows the harness author to leverage the same `HarnessPredicate` to enable more powerful APIs on their harness class. For example, consider the `getItems` method on the `MyMenuHarness` shown above. Adding a filtering API allows users of the harness to search for particular menu items:

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyMenuHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-menu';

  /** Gets a list of items in the menu, optionally filtered based on the given criteria. */
  async getItems(filters: MyMenuItemHarnessFilters = {}): Promise<MyMenuItemHarness[]> {
    const getFilteredItems = this.locatorForAll(MyMenuItemHarness.with(filters));
    return getFilteredItems();
  }
  ...
}
</docs-code>

## Creating `HarnessLoader` for elements that use content projection

Some components project additional content into the component's template. See the [content projection guide](guide/components/content-projection) for more information.

Add a `HarnessLoader` instance scoped to the element containing the `<ng-content>` when you create a harness for a component that uses content projection. This allows the user of the harness to load additional harnesses for whatever components were passed in as content. `ComponentHarness` has several methods that can be used to create HarnessLoader instances for cases like this: `harnessLoaderFor()`, `harnessLoaderForOptional()`, `harnessLoaderForAll()`. See the [HarnessLoader interface API reference page](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#HarnessLoader) for more details.

For example, the `MyPopupHarness` example from above can extend `ContentContainerComponentHarness` to add support to load harnesses within the `<ng-content>` of the component.

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ContentContainerComponentHarness<string> {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';
}
</docs-code>

## Accessing elements outside of the component's host element

There are times when a component harness might need to access elements outside of its corresponding component's host element. For example, code that displays a floating element or pop-up often attaches DOM elements directly to the document body, such as the `Overlay` service in Angular CDK.

In this case, `ComponentHarness` provides a method that can be used to get a `LocatorFactory` for the root element of the document. The `LocatorFactory` supports most of the same APIs as the `ComponentHarness` base class, and can then be used to query relative to the document's root element.

Consider if the `MyPopup` component above used the CDK overlay for the popup content, rather than an element in its own template. In this case, `MyPopupHarness` would have to access the content element via `documentRootLocatorFactory()` method that gets a locator factory rooted at the document root.

<docs-code language="typescript">
class MyPopupHarness extends ComponentHarness {
  static hostSelector = 'my-popup';

  /** Gets a `HarnessLoader` whose root element is the popup's content element. */
  async getHarnessLoaderForContent(): Promise<HarnessLoader> {
    const rootLocator = this.documentRootLocatorFactory();
    return rootLocator.harnessLoaderFor('my-popup-content');
  }
}
</docs-code>

## Waiting for asynchronous tasks

The methods on `TestElement` automatically trigger Angular's change detection and wait for tasks inside the `NgZone`. In most cases no special effort is required for harness authors to wait on asynchronous tasks. However, there are some edge cases where this may not be sufficient.

Under some circumstances, Angular animations may require a second cycle of change detection and subsequent `NgZone` stabilization before animation events are fully flushed. In cases where this is needed, the `ComponentHarness` offers a `forceStabilize()` method that can be called to do the second round.

You can use `NgZone.runOutsideAngular()` to schedule tasks outside of NgZone. Call the `waitForTasksOutsideAngular()` method on the corresponding harness if you need to explicitly wait for tasks outside `NgZone` since this does not happen automatically.

# Debugging tests

If your tests aren't working as you expect them to, you can inspect and debug them in the browser.

Debug specs in the browser in the same way that you debug an application.

1. Reveal the Karma browser window.
    See [Set up testing](guide/testing#set-up-testing) if you need help with this step.

1. Click the **DEBUG** button to open a new browser tab and re-run the tests.
1. Open the browser's **Developer Tools**. On Windows, press `Ctrl-Shift-I`. On macOS, press `Command-Option-I`.
1. Pick the **Sources** section.
1. Press `Control/Command-P`, and then start typing the name of your test file to open it.
1. Set a breakpoint in the test.
1. Refresh the browser, and notice how it stops at the breakpoint.

# Testing

Testing your Angular application helps you check that your application is working as you expect.

## Set up testing

The Angular CLI downloads and installs everything you need to test an Angular application with [Jasmine testing framework](https://jasmine.github.io).

The project you create with the CLI is immediately ready to test.
Just run the [`ng test`](cli/test) CLI command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng test

</docs-code>

The `ng test` command builds the application in *watch mode*,
and launches the [Karma test runner](https://karma-runner.github.io).

The console output looks like below:

<docs-code language="shell">

02 11 2022 09:08:28.605:INFO [karma-server]: Karma v6.4.1 server started at http://localhost:9876/
02 11 2022 09:08:28.607:INFO [launcher]: Launching browsers Chrome with concurrency unlimited
02 11 2022 09:08:28.620:INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
02 11 2022 09:08:31.312:INFO [Chrome]: Connected on socket -LaEYvD2R7MdcS0-AAAB with id 31534482
Chrome: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.193 secs / 0.172 secs)
TOTAL: 3 SUCCESS

</docs-code>

The last line of the log shows that Karma ran three tests that all passed.

The test output is displayed in the browser using [Karma Jasmine HTML Reporter](https://github.com/dfederm/karma-jasmine-html-reporter).

<img alt="Jasmine HTML Reporter in the browser" src="assets/images/guide/testing/initial-jasmine-html-reporter.png">

Click on a test row to re-run just that test or click on a description to re-run the tests in the selected test group \("test suite"\).

Meanwhile, the `ng test` command is watching for changes.

To see this in action, make a small change to `app.component.ts` and save.
The tests run again, the browser refreshes, and the new test results appear.

## Configuration

The Angular CLI takes care of Jasmine and Karma configuration for you. It constructs the full configuration in memory, based on options specified in the `angular.json` file.

If you want to customize Karma, you can create a `karma.conf.js` by running the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">

ng generate config karma

</docs-code>

HELPFUL: Read more about Karma configuration in the [Karma configuration guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/config/configuration-file.html).

### Other test frameworks

You can also unit test an Angular application with other testing libraries and test runners.
Each library and runner has its own distinctive installation procedures, configuration, and syntax.

### Test file name and location

Inside the `src/app` folder the Angular CLI generated a test file for the `AppComponent` named `app.component.spec.ts`.

IMPORTANT: The test file extension **must be `.spec.ts`** so that tooling can identify it as a file with tests \(also known as a *spec* file\).

The `app.component.ts` and `app.component.spec.ts` files are siblings in the same folder.
The root file names \(`app.component`\) are the same for both files.

Adopt these two conventions in your own projects for *every kind* of test file.

#### Place your spec file next to the file it tests

It's a good idea to put unit test spec files in the same folder
as the application source code files that they test:

* Such tests are painless to find
* You see at a glance if a part of your application lacks tests
* Nearby tests can reveal how a part works in context
* When you move the source \(inevitable\), you remember to move the test
* When you rename the source file \(inevitable\), you remember to rename the test file

#### Place your spec files in a test folder

Application integration specs can test the interactions of multiple parts
spread across folders and modules.
They don't really belong to any part in particular, so they don't have a
natural home next to any one file.

It's often better to create an appropriate folder for them in the `tests` directory.

Of course specs that test the test helpers belong in the `test` folder,
next to their corresponding helper files.

## Testing in continuous integration

One of the best ways to keep your project bug-free is through a test suite, but you might forget to run tests all the time.

Continuous integration \(CI\) servers let you set up your project repository so that your tests run on every commit and pull request.

To test your Angular CLI application in Continuous integration \(CI\) run the following command:

<docs-code language="shell">
ng test --no-watch --no-progress --browsers=ChromeHeadless
</docs-code>

================================================
# Testing Pipes

You can test [pipes](guide/templates/pipes) without the Angular testing utilities.

## Testing the `TitleCasePipe`

A pipe class has one method, `transform`, that manipulates the input value into a transformed output value.
The `transform` implementation rarely interacts with the DOM.
Most pipes have no dependence on Angular other than the `@Pipe` metadata and an interface.

Consider a `TitleCasePipe` that capitalizes the first letter of each word.
Here's an implementation with a regular expression.

<docs-code header="app/shared/title-case.pipe.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/title-case.pipe.ts"/>

Anything that uses a regular expression is worth testing thoroughly.
Use simple Jasmine to explore the expected cases and the edge cases.

<docs-code header="app/shared/title-case.pipe.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/shared/title-case.pipe.spec.ts" visibleRegion="excerpt"/>

## Writing DOM tests to support a pipe test

These are tests of the pipe *in isolation*.
They can't tell if the `TitleCasePipe` is working properly as applied in the application components.

Consider adding component tests such as this one:

<docs-code header="app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts (pipe test)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/hero/hero-detail.component.spec.ts" visibleRegion="title-case-pipe"/>



================================================
FILE: adev/src/content/guide/testing/services.md
================================================
# Testing services

To check that your services are working as you intend, you can write tests specifically for them.

Services are often the smoothest files to unit test.
Here are some synchronous and asynchronous unit tests of the `ValueService` written without assistance from Angular testing utilities.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="ValueService"/>

## Services with dependencies

Services often depend on other services that Angular injects into the constructor.
In many cases, you can create and *inject* these dependencies by hand while calling the service's constructor.

The `MasterService` is a simple example:

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.ts" visibleRegion="MasterService"/>

`MasterService` delegates its only method, `getValue`, to the injected `ValueService`.

Here are several ways to test it.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="MasterService"/>

The first test creates a `ValueService` with `new` and passes it to the `MasterService` constructor.

However, injecting the real service rarely works well as most dependent services are difficult to create and control.

Instead, mock the dependency, use a dummy value, or create a [spy](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite#section-Spies) on the pertinent service method.

HELPFUL: Prefer spies as they are usually the best way to mock services.

These standard testing techniques are great for unit testing services in isolation.

However, you almost always inject services into application classes using Angular dependency injection and you should have tests that reflect that usage pattern.
Angular testing utilities make it straightforward to investigate how injected services behave.

## Testing services with the `TestBed`

Your application relies on Angular [dependency injection (DI)](guide/di) to create services.
When a service has a dependent service, DI finds or creates that dependent service.
And if that dependent service has its own dependencies, DI finds-or-creates them as well.

As a service *consumer*, you don't worry about any of this.
You don't worry about the order of constructor arguments or how they're created.

As a service *tester*, you must at least think about the first level of service dependencies but you *can* let Angular DI do the service creation and deal with constructor argument order when you use the `TestBed` testing utility to provide and create services.

## Angular `TestBed`

The `TestBed` is the most important of the Angular testing utilities.
The `TestBed` creates a dynamically-constructed Angular *test* module that emulates an Angular [@NgModule](guide/ngmodules).

The `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` method takes a metadata object that can have most of the properties of an [@NgModule](guide/ngmodules).

To test a service, you set the `providers` metadata property with an array of the services that you'll test or mock.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts (provide ValueService in beforeEach)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-before-each"/>

Then inject it inside a test by calling `TestBed.inject()` with the service class as the argument.

HELPFUL: `TestBed.get()` was deprecated as of Angular version 9.
To help minimize breaking changes, Angular introduces a new function called `TestBed.inject()`, which you should use instead.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-inject-it"/>

Or inside the `beforeEach()` if you prefer to inject the service as part of your setup.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="value-service-inject-before-each"> </docs-code>

When testing a service with a dependency, provide the mock in the `providers` array.

In the following example, the mock is a spy object.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="master-service-before-each"/>

The test consumes that spy in the same way it did earlier.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="master-service-it"/>

## Testing without `beforeEach()`

Most test suites in this guide call `beforeEach()` to set the preconditions for each `it()` test and rely on the `TestBed` to create classes and inject services.

There's another school of testing that never calls `beforeEach()` and prefers to create classes explicitly rather than use the `TestBed`.

Here's how you might rewrite one of the `MasterService` tests in that style.

Begin by putting re-usable, preparatory code in a *setup* function instead of `beforeEach()`.

<docs-code header="app/demo/demo.spec.ts (setup)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-setup"/>

The `setup()` function returns an object literal with the variables, such as `masterService`, that a test might reference.
You don't define *semi-global* variables \(for example, `let masterService: MasterService`\) in the body of the `describe()`.

Then each test invokes `setup()` in its first line, before continuing with steps that manipulate the test subject and assert expectations.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-test"/>

Notice how the test uses [*destructuring assignment*](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to extract the setup variables that it needs.

<docs-code path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.spec.ts" visibleRegion="no-before-each-setup-call"/>

Many developers feel this approach is cleaner and more explicit than the traditional `beforeEach()` style.

Although this testing guide follows the traditional style and the default [CLI schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) generate test files with `beforeEach()` and `TestBed`, feel free to adopt *this alternative approach* in your own projects.

## Testing HTTP services

Data services that make HTTP calls to remote servers typically inject and delegate to the Angular [`HttpClient`](guide/http/testing) service for XHR calls.

You can test a data service with an injected `HttpClient` spy as you would test any service with a dependency.

<docs-code header="app/model/hero.service.spec.ts (tests with spies)" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/model/hero.service.spec.ts" visibleRegion="test-with-spies"/>

IMPORTANT: The `HeroService` methods return `Observables`.
You must *subscribe* to an observable to \(a\) cause it to execute and \(b\) assert that the method succeeds or fails.

The `subscribe()` method takes a success \(`next`\) and fail \(`error`\) callback.
Make sure you provide *both* callbacks so that you capture errors.
Neglecting to do so produces an asynchronous uncaught observable error that the test runner will likely attribute to a completely different test.

## `HttpClientTestingModule`

Extended interactions between a data service and the `HttpClient` can be complex and difficult to mock with spies.

The `HttpClientTestingModule` can make these testing scenarios more manageable.

While the *code sample* accompanying this guide demonstrates `HttpClientTestingModule`, this page defers to the [Http guide](guide/http/testing), which covers testing with the `HttpClientTestingModule` in detail.

================================================
# Using component harnesses in tests

## Before you start

TIP: This guide assumes you've already read the [component harnesses overview guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-overview). Read that first if you're new to using component harnesses.

### CDK Installation

The [Component Dev Kit (CDK)](https://material.angular.io/cdk/categories) is a set of behavior primitives for building components. To use the component harnesses, first install `@angular/cdk` from npm. You can do this from your terminal using the Angular CLI:

<docs-code language="shell">
  ng add @angular/cdk
</docs-code>

## Test harness environments and loaders

You can use component test harnesses in different test environments. Angular CDK supports two built-in environments:
- Unit tests with Angular's `TestBed`
- End-to-end tests with [WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver)


Each environment provides a <strong>harness loader</strong>. The loader creates the harness instances you use throughout your tests. See below for more specific guidance on supported testing environments.

Additional testing environments require custom bindings. See the [adding harness support for additional testing environments guide](guide/testing/component-harnesses-testing-environments) for more information.

### Using the loader from `TestbedHarnessEnvironment` for unit tests

For unit tests you can create a harness loader from [TestbedHarnessEnvironment](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#TestbedHarnessEnvironment). This environment uses a [component fixture](api/core/testing/ComponentFixture) created by Angular's `TestBed`.

To create a harness loader rooted at the fixture's root element, use the `loader()` method:

<docs-code language="typescript">
const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);

// Create a harness loader from the fixture
const loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);
...

// Use the loader to get harness instances
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

To create a harness loader for harnesses for elements that fall outside the fixture, use the `documentRootLoader()` method. For example, code that displays a floating element or pop-up often attaches DOM elements directly to the document body, such as the `Overlay` service in Angular CDK.

You can also create a harness loader directly with `harnessForFixture()` for a harness at that fixture's root element directly.

### Using the loader from `SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment` for end-to-end tests

For WebDriver-based end-to-end tests you can create a harness loader with `SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment`.

Use the `loader()` method to get the harness loader instance for the current HTML document, rooted at the document's root element. This environment uses a WebDriver client.

<docs-code language="typescript">
let wd: webdriver.WebDriver = getMyWebDriverClient();
const loader = SeleniumWebDriverHarnessEnvironment.loader(wd);
...
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

## Using a harness loader

Harness loader instances correspond to a specific DOM element and are used to create component harness instances for elements under that specific element.

To get `ComponentHarness` for the first instance of the element, use the `getHarness()` method. To get all `ComponentHarness` instances, use the `getAllHarnesses()` method.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Get harness for first instance of the element
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);

// Get harnesses for all instances of the element
const myComponentHarnesses = await loader.getHarnesses(MyComponent);
</docs-code>

As an example, consider a reusable dialog-button component that opens a dialog on click. It contains the following components, each with a corresponding harness:
- `MyDialogButton` (composes the `MyButton` and `MyDialog` with a convenient API)
- `MyButton` (a standard button component)
- `MyDialog` (a dialog appended to `document.body` by `MyDialogButton` upon click)

The following test loads harnesses for each of these components:

<docs-code language="typescript">
let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyDialogButton>;
let loader: HarnessLoader;
let rootLoader: HarnessLoader;

beforeEach(() => {
  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyDialogButton);
  loader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.loader(fixture);
  rootLoader = TestbedHarnessEnvironment.documentRootLoader(fixture);
});

it('loads harnesses', async () => {
  // Load a harness for the bootstrapped component with `harnessForFixture`
  dialogButtonHarness =
      await TestbedHarnessEnvironment.harnessForFixture(fixture, MyDialogButtonHarness);
  // The button element is inside the fixture's root element, so we use `loader`.
  const buttonHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);
  // Click the button to open the dialog
  await buttonHarness.click();
  // The dialog is appended to `document.body`, outside of the fixture's root element,
  // so we use `rootLoader` in this case.
  const dialogHarness = await rootLoader.getHarness(MyDialogHarness);
  // ... make some assertions
});
</docs-code>

### Harness behavior in different environments

Harnesses may not behave exactly the same in all environments. Some differences are unavoidable between the real user interaction versus the simulated events generated in unit tests. Angular CDK makes a best effort to normalize the behavior to the extent possible.

### Interacting with child elements

To interact with elements below the root element of this harness loader, use the `HarnessLoader` instance of a child element. For the first instance of the child element, use the `getChildLoader()` method. For all instances of the child element, use the `getAllChildLoaders()` method.

<docs-code language="typescript">
const myComponentHarness = await loader.getHarness(MyComponent);

// Get loader for first instance of child element with '.child' selector
const childLoader = await myComponentHarness.getLoader('.child');

// Get loaders for all instances of child elements with '.child' selector
const allChildLoaders = await myComponentHarness.getAllChildLoaders('.child');
</docs-code>

### Filtering harnesses

When a page contains multiple instances of a particular component, you may want to filter based on some property of the component to get a particular component instance. You can use a <strong>harness predicate</strong>, a class used to associate a `ComponentHarness` class with predicates functions that can be used to filter component instances, to do so.

When you ask a `HarnessLoader` for a harness, you're actually providing a HarnessQuery. A query can be one of two things:
- A harness constructor. This just gets that harness
- A `HarnessPredicate`, which gets harnesses that are filtered based on one or more conditions

`HarnessPredicate` does support some base filters (selector, ancestor) that work on anything that extends `ComponentHarness`.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of loading a MyButtonComponentHarness with a harness predicate
const disabledButtonPredicate = new HarnessPredicate(MyButtonComponentHarness, {selector: '[disabled]'});
const disabledButton = await loader.getHarness(disabledButtonPredicate);
</docs-code>

However it's common for harnesses to implement a static `with()` method that accepts component-specific filtering options and returns a `HarnessPredicate`.

<docs-code language="typescript">
// Example of loading a MyButtonComponentHarness with a specific selector
const button = await loader.getHarness(MyButtonComponentHarness.with({selector: 'btn'}))
</docs-code>

For more details refer to the specific harness documentation since additional filtering options are specific to each harness implementation.

## Using test harness APIs

While every harness defines an API specific to its corresponding component, they all share a common base class, [ComponentHarness](https://material.angular.io/cdk/testing/api#ComponentHarness). This base class defines a static property, `hostSelector`, that matches the harness class to instances of the component in the DOM.

Beyond that, the API of any given harness is specific to its corresponding component; refer to the component's documentation to learn how to use a specific harness.

As an example, the following is a test for a component that uses the [Angular Material slider component harness](https://material.angular.io/components/slider/api#MatSliderHarness):

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('should get value of slider thumb', async () => {
    const slider = await loader.getHarness(MatSliderHarness);
    const thumb = await slider.getEndThumb();
    expect(await thumb.getValue()).toBe(50);
});
</docs-code>

## Interop with Angular change detection

By default, test harnesses runs Angular's [change detection](https://angular.dev/best-practices/runtime-performance) before reading the state of a DOM element and after interacting with a DOM element.

There may be times that you need finer-grained control over change detection in your tests. such as checking the state of a component while an async operation is pending. In these cases use the `manualChangeDetection` function to disable automatic handling of change detection for a block of code.

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('checks state while async action is in progress', async () => {
  const buttonHarness = loader.getHarness(MyButtonHarness);
  await manualChangeDetection(async () => {
    await buttonHarness.click();
    fixture.detectChanges();
    // Check expectations while async click operation is in progress.
    expect(isProgressSpinnerVisible()).toBe(true);
    await fixture.whenStable();
    // Check expectations after async click operation complete.
    expect(isProgressSpinnerVisible()).toBe(false);
  });
});
</docs-code>

Almost all harness methods are asynchronous and return a `Promise` to support the following:
- Support for unit tests
- Support for end-to-end tests
- Insulate tests against changes in asynchronous behavior

The Angular team recommends using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) to improve the test readability. Calling `await` blocks the execution of your test until the associated `Promise` resolves.

Occasionally, you may want to perform multiple actions simultaneously and wait until they're all done rather than performing each action sequentially. For example, read multiple properties of a single component. In these situations use the `parallel` function to parallelize the operations. The parallel function works similarly to `Promise.all`, while also optimizing change detection checks.

<docs-code language="typescript">
it('reads properties in parallel', async () => {
  const checkboxHarness = loader.getHarness(MyCheckboxHarness);
  // Read the checked and intermediate properties simultaneously.
  const [checked, indeterminate] = await parallel(() => [
    checkboxHarness.isChecked(),
    checkboxHarness.isIndeterminate()
  ]);
  expect(checked).toBe(false);
  expect(indeterminate).toBe(true);
});
</docs-code>

# Testing Utility APIs

This page describes the most useful Angular testing features.

The Angular testing utilities include the `TestBed`, the `ComponentFixture`, and a handful of functions that control the test environment.
The [`TestBed`](#testbed-api-summary) and [`ComponentFixture`](#component-fixture-api-summary) classes are covered separately.

Here's a summary of the stand-alone functions, in order of likely utility:

| Function                     | Details |

| `waitForAsync`               | Runs the body of a test \(`it`\) or setup \(`beforeEach`\) function within a special *async test zone*. See [waitForAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#waitForAsync).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `fakeAsync`                  | Runs the body of a test \(`it`\) within a special *fakeAsync test zone*, enabling a linear control flow coding style. See [fakeAsync](guide/testing/components-scenarios#fake-async).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tick`                       | Simulates the passage of time and the completion of pending asynchronous activities by flushing both *timer* and *micro-task* queues within the *fakeAsync test zone*.  The curious, dedicated reader might enjoy this lengthy blog post, ["*Tasks, microtasks, queues and schedules*"](https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules).  Accepts an optional argument that moves the virtual clock forward by the specified number of milliseconds, clearing asynchronous activities scheduled within that timeframe. See [tick](guide/testing/components-scenarios#tick). |
| `inject`                     | Injects one or more services from the current `TestBed` injector into a test function. It cannot inject a service provided by the component itself. See discussion of the [debugElement.injector](guide/testing/components-scenarios#get-injected-services).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `discardPeriodicTasks`       | When a `fakeAsync()` test ends with pending timer event *tasks* \(queued `setTimeOut` and `setInterval` callbacks\), the test fails with a clear error message. <br /> In general, a test should end with no queued tasks. When pending timer tasks are expected, call `discardPeriodicTasks` to flush the *task* queue and avoid the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `flushMicrotasks`            | When a `fakeAsync()` test ends with pending *micro-tasks* such as unresolved promises, the test fails with a clear error message. <br /> In general, a test should wait for micro-tasks to finish. When pending microtasks are expected, call `flushMicrotasks` to flush the  *micro-task* queue and avoid the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `ComponentFixtureAutoDetect` | A provider token for a service that turns on [automatic change detection](guide/testing/components-scenarios#automatic-change-detection).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `getTestBed`                 | Gets the current instance of the `TestBed`. Usually unnecessary because the static class methods of the `TestBed` class are typically sufficient. The `TestBed` instance exposes a few rarely used members that are not available as static methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## `TestBed` class summary

The `TestBed` class is one of the principal Angular testing utilities.
Its API is quite large and can be overwhelming until you've explored it, a little at a time.
Read the early part of this guide first to get the basics before trying to absorb the full API.

The module definition passed to `configureTestingModule` is a subset of the `@NgModule` metadata properties.

<docs-code language="javascript">

type TestModuleMetadata = {
  providers?: any[];
  declarations?: any[];
  imports?: any[];
  schemas?: Array<SchemaMetadata | any[]>;
};

</docs-code>

Each override method takes a `MetadataOverride<T>` where `T` is the kind of metadata appropriate to the method, that is, the parameter of an `@NgModule`, `@Component`, `@Directive`, or `@Pipe`.

<docs-code language="javascript">

type MetadataOverride<T> = {
  add?: Partial<T>;
  remove?: Partial<T>;
  set?: Partial<T>;
};

</docs-code>

The `TestBed` API consists of static class methods that either update or reference a *global* instance of the `TestBed`.

Internally, all static methods cover methods of the current runtime `TestBed` instance, which is also returned by the `getTestBed()` function.

Call `TestBed` methods *within* a `beforeEach()` to ensure a fresh start before each individual test.

Here are the most important static methods, in order of likely utility.

| Methods                                                        | Details |
|:---                                                            |:---     |
| `configureTestingModule`                                       | The testing shims \(`karma-test-shim`, `browser-test-shim`\) establish the [initial test environment](guide/testing) and a default testing module. The default testing module is configured with basic declaratives and some Angular service substitutes that every tester needs. <br /> Call `configureTestingModule` to refine the testing module configuration for a particular set of tests by adding and removing imports, declarations \(of components, directives, and pipes\), and providers.                                                                                                                                              |
| `compileComponents`                                            | Compile the testing module asynchronously after you've finished configuring it. You **must** call this method if *any* of the testing module components have a `templateUrl` or `styleUrls` because fetching component template and style files is necessarily asynchronous. See [compileComponents](guide/testing/components-scenarios#calling-compilecomponents). <br /> After calling `compileComponents`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `createComponent<T>`                                     | Create an instance of a component of type `T` based on the current `TestBed` configuration. After calling `createComponent`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `overrideModule`                                               | Replace metadata for the given `NgModule`. Recall that modules can import other modules. The `overrideModule` method can reach deeply into the current testing module to modify one of these inner modules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `overrideComponent`                                            | Replace metadata for the given component class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `overrideDirective`                                            | Replace metadata for the given directive class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `overridePipe`                                                 | Replace metadata for the given pipe class, which could be nested deeply within an inner module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

 `inject`                           | Retrieve a service from the current `TestBed` injector. The `inject` function is often adequate for this purpose. But `inject` throws an error if it can't provide the service. <br /> What if the service is optional? <br /> The `TestBed.inject()` method takes an optional second parameter, the object to return if Angular can't find the provider \(`null` in this example\): <docs-code header="app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" path="adev/src/content/examples/testing/src/app/demo/demo.testbed.spec.ts" visibleRegion="testbed-get-w-null"/> After calling `TestBed.inject`, the `TestBed` configuration is frozen for the duration of the current spec. |
|
 `initTestEnvironment` | Initialize the testing environment for the entire test run. <br /> The testing shims \(`karma-test-shim`, `browser-test-shim`\) call it for you so there is rarely a reason for you to call it yourself. <br /> Call this method *exactly once*. To change this default in the middle of a test run, call `resetTestEnvironment` first. <br /> Specify the Angular compiler factory, a `PlatformRef`, and a default Angular testing module. Alternatives for non-browser platforms are available in the general form `@angular/platform-<platform_name>/testing/<platform_name>`.                                                                  |
| `resetTestEnvironment`                                         | Reset the initial test environment, including the default testing module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

A few of the `TestBed` instance methods are not covered by static `TestBed` *class* methods.
These are rarely needed.

## The `ComponentFixture`

The `TestBed.createComponent<T>` creates an instance of the component `T` and returns a strongly typed `ComponentFixture` for that component.

The `ComponentFixture` properties and methods provide access to the component, its DOM representation, and aspects of its Angular environment.

### `ComponentFixture` properties

Here are the most important properties for testers, in order of likely utility.

| Properties          | Details |
|:---                 |:---     |
| `componentInstance` | The instance of the component class created by `TestBed.createComponent`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `debugElement`      | The `DebugElement` associated with the root element of the component. <br /> The `debugElement` provides insight into the component and its DOM element during test and debugging. It's a critical property for testers. The most interesting members are covered [below](#debug-element-details). |
| `nativeElement`     | The native DOM element at the root of the component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `changeDetectorRef` | The `ChangeDetectorRef` for the component. <br /> The `ChangeDetectorRef` is most valuable when testing a component that has the `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` method or the component's change detection is under your programmatic control.                                                   |

### `ComponentFixture` methods

The *fixture* methods cause Angular to perform certain tasks on the component tree.
Call these method to trigger Angular behavior in response to simulated user action.

Here are the most useful methods for testers.

| Methods             | Details |
|:---                 |:---     |
| `detectChanges`     | Trigger a change detection cycle for the component. <br /> Call it to initialize the component \(it calls `ngOnInit`\) and after your test code, change the component's data bound property values. Angular can't see that you've changed `personComponent.name` and won't update the `name` binding until you call `detectChanges`. <br /> Runs `checkNoChanges` afterwards to confirm that there are no circular updates unless called as `detectChanges(false)`;                                                                                    |
| `autoDetectChanges` | Set this to `true` when you want the fixture to detect changes automatically. <br /> When autodetect is `true`, the test fixture calls `detectChanges` immediately after creating the component. Then it listens for pertinent zone events and calls `detectChanges` accordingly. When your test code modifies component property values directly, you probably still have to call `fixture.detectChanges` to trigger data binding updates. <br /> The default is `false`. Testers who prefer fine control over test behavior tend to keep it `false`. |
| `checkNoChanges`    | Do a change detection run to make sure there are no pending changes. Throws an exceptions if there are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `isStable`          | If the fixture is currently *stable*, returns `true`. If there are async tasks that have not completed, returns `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `whenStable`        | Returns a promise that resolves when the fixture is stable. <br /> To resume testing after completion of asynchronous activity or asynchronous change detection, hook that promise. See [whenStable](guide/testing/components-scenarios#whenstable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `destroy`           | Trigger component destruction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### `DebugElement`

The `DebugElement` provides crucial insights into the component's DOM representation.

From the test root component's `DebugElement` returned by `fixture.debugElement`, you can walk \(and query\) the fixture's entire element and component subtrees.

Here are the most useful `DebugElement` members for testers, in approximate order of utility:

| Members               | Details |
|:---                   |:---     |
| `nativeElement`       | The corresponding DOM element in the browser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `query`               | Calling `query(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>)` returns the first `DebugElement` that matches the [predicate](#query-predicate) at any depth in the subtree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `queryAll`            | Calling `queryAll(predicate: Predicate<DebugElement>)` returns all `DebugElements` that matches the [predicate](#query-predicate) at any depth in subtree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `injector`            | The host dependency injector. For example, the root element's component instance injector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `componentInstance`   | The element's own component instance, if it has one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `context`             | An object that provides parent context for this element. Often an ancestor component instance that governs this element. <br /> When an element is repeated within `*ngFor`, the context is an `NgForOf` whose `$implicit` property is the value of the row instance value. For example, the `hero` in `*ngFor="let hero of heroes"`.                                                                   |
| `children`            | The immediate `DebugElement` children. Walk the tree by descending through `children`.  `DebugElement` also has `childNodes`, a list of `DebugNode` objects. `DebugElement` derives from `DebugNode` objects and there are often more nodes than elements. Testers can usually ignore plain nodes.                                                                  |
| `parent`              | The `DebugElement` parent. Null if this is the root element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `name`                | The element tag name, if it is an element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `triggerEventHandler` | Triggers the event by its name if there is a corresponding listener in the element's `listeners` collection. The second parameter is the *event object* expected by the handler. See [triggerEventHandler](guide/testing/components-scenarios#trigger-event-handler). <br /> If the event lacks a listener or there's some other problem, consider calling `nativeElement.dispatchEvent(eventObject)`. |
| `listeners`           | The callbacks attached to the component's `@Output` properties and/or the element's event properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `providerTokens`      | This component's injector lookup tokens. Includes the component itself plus the tokens that the component lists in its `providers` metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `source`              | Where to find this element in the source component template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `references`          | Dictionary of objects associated with template local variables \(for example, `#foo`\), keyed by the local variable name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The `DebugElement.query(predicate)` and `DebugElement.queryAll(predicate)` methods take a predicate that filters the source element's subtree for matching `DebugElement`.

The predicate is any method that takes a `DebugElement` and returns a *truthy* value.
The following example finds all `DebugElements` with a reference to a template local variable named "content":
